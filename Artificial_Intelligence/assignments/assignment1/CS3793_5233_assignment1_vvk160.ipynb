    "This assignment is focused on **python file reading, graph creation** and implementation of **search algorithms**. \n",
    "In the following sections, you will complete a series of tasks for a made up problem of *Coronavirus in Texas*.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Coronavirus is non-discriminatory, in the sense that it can spread from one city to any other city. The only goal of the virus is to spread to all cities in Texas. Find a possible way for the virus to spread (Uninformed Search).\n",
    "*   To counter the effect of the virus, vaccine needs to be distributed to all cities. One city has more demand than supply, whereas one city has a shortage of vaccines. The goal is to find an **optimal** strategy to transport the vaccine (Informed Search) from the city with high supply (low demand) to the city with low supply (high demand).\n",

However, you **CANNOT** use a complete library for the search algorithms. You can get pieces of code from online, but please cite the source properly.\n"

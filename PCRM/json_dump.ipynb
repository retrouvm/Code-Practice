      "    \"abstract\": \"Hepatic fibrosis is a common pathologic stage in chronic liver disease development, which might ultimately lead to liver cirrhosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs)-based therapies show excellent therapeutic potential in liver injury disease owing to its superior properties, including tissue repair ability and immunomodulation effect. However, cell-based therapy still limits to several problems, such as engraftment efficiency and immunoreaction, which impede the ADSCs-based therapeutics development. So, ADSCs-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially for exosomes (ADSC-EXO), emerge as a promise cell-free therapeutics to ameliorate liver fibrosis. The effect and underlying mechanisms of ADSC-EXO in liver fibrosis remains blurred.\\nHepatic fibrosis murine model was established by intraperitoneal sequential injecting the diethylnitrosamine (DEN) for two weeks and then carbon tetrachloride (CCl\\nIn this study, we obtained isolated ADSCs, collected and separated ADSCs-derived exosomes. We found that ADSC-EXO treatment could efficiently ameliorate DEN/CCl\\nThese findings demonstrated that ADSC-derived exosomes could efficiently alleviate hepatic fibrosis by suppressing HSCs activation and remodeling glutamine and ammonia metabolism mediated by hepatocellular glutamine synthetase, which might be a novel and promising anti-fibrotic therapeutics for hepatic fibrosis disease.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The repair of cranio-maxillofacial bone defects remains a formidable clinical challenge. The Ets variant 2 (ETV2) transcription factor, which belongs to the E26 transformation-specific (ETS) family, has been reported to play a key role in neovascularization. However, the role of ETV2 in the osteogenesis of human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) remains unexplored.\\nTransgenic overexpression of ETV2 was achieved using a lentiviral vector, based on a Dox-inducible system. The effects of Dox-induced overexpression of ETV2 on the osteogenesis of hDPSCs were evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot, immunofluorescence staining, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, and Alizarin Red S (ARS) staining. Additionally, RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis was performed to analyze the underlying mechanisms of ETV2-induced osteogenesis. Additionally, the role of ETV2 overexpression in bone formation in vivo was validated by animal studies with a rat calvarial defect model and a nude mice model.\\nOur results demonstrated that ETV2 overexpression significantly upregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of osteogenic markers, markedly enhanced ALP activity, and promoted matrix mineralization of hDPSCs. Moreover, the results of RNA-Seq analysis and western blot showed that the ERK/MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways were activated upon transgenic overexpression of ETV2. The enhanced osteogenic differentiation of hDPSCs due to ETV2 overexpression was partially reversed by treatment with inhibitors of ERK/MAPK or PI3K-AKT signaling. Furthermore, the results of in vivo studies demonstrated that ETV2 overexpression improved bone healing in a rat calvarial defect model and increased ectopic bone formation in nude mice.\\nCollectively, our results indicated that ETV2 overexpression exerted positive effects on the osteogenesis of hDPSCs, at least partially via the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.\",\n",

In this study, we combined testicular culture and xenotransplantation into an integrative model and explored whether immature testicular tissue would survive and continue to develop in this model.\\nIn the new integrative model group, the testes of neonatal rats on postnatal day 8 (PND 8) were cultured for 4\\u00a0days ex vivo and then were transplanted under the dorsal skin of castrated nude mice. The xenografted testes were resected on the 57th day after xenotransplantation and the testes of rats in the control group were harvested on PND 69. The survival state of testicular tissue was evaluated from morphological and functional perspectives including H&E staining, immunohistochemical staining of 8-OH-dG, immunofluorescence staining, TUNEL assay, ultrastructural study, gene expression and protein analysis.\\n(a) We found that complete spermatogenesis was established in the testes in the new integrative model group. Compared with the control in the same stage, the seminiferous epithelium in some tubules was a bit thinner and there were vacuoles in part of the tubules. Immunofluorescence staining revealed some ACROSIN-positive spermatids were present in seminiferous tubule of xenografted testes. TUNEL detection showed apoptotic cells and most of them were germ cells in the new integrative model group. 8-OH-dG immunohistochemistry showed strongly positive-stained in the seminiferous epithelium after xenotransplantation in comparison with the control group; (b) Compared with the control group, the expressions of FOXA3, DAZL, GFR\\u03b11, BOLL, SYCP3, CDC25A, LDHC, CREM and MKI67 in the new integrative model group were significantly elevated (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), indicating that the testicular tissue was in an active differentiated and proliferative state; (c) Antioxidant gene detection showed that the expression of Nrf2, Keap1, NQO1 and SOD1 in the new integrative model group was significantly higher than those in the control group (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05), and DNA methyltransferase gene detection showed that the expression of DNMT3B was significantly elevated as well (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).\\nThe new integrative model could maintain the viability of immature testicular tissue and sustain the long-term survival in vivo with complete spermatogenesis. However, testicular genes expression was altered, vacuolation and thin seminiferous epithelium were still apparent in this model, manifesting that oxidative damage may contribute to the testicular development lesion and it needs further study in order to optimize this model.\",\n",

The overall RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) level was determined using an m6A RNA methylation assay kit. The expression of METTL3 was quantified via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. Subsequently, the level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) was identified by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Moreover, we assessed the effect of METTL3 by transfecting cells with siRNA (in vitro) or adeno-associated virus (in vivo). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and slit-lamp biomicroscopy were performed to evaluate corneal damage. Furthermore, the state of NF-\\u03baB signaling pathway activation was examined by Western blotting. In addition, RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed to evaluate levels of the pro-inflammatory factors interleukin-1\\u03b2 (IL-1\\u03b2), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-\\u0251.\\nOur data demonstrated that the levels of the RNA m6A methylation and METTL3 were dramatically increased and that the NF-\\u03baB signaling pathway was activated in Fusarium solani-induced keratitis. Inhibition of METTL3 decreased the level of TRAF6, downregulated the phospho-p65(p-p65)/p65 and phospho-I\\u03baB(p-I\\u03baB)/I\\u03baB protein ratios, simultaneously attenuating the inflammatory response and fungal burden in FK.\\nOur research suggests that the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 regulates the inflammatory response in FK by modulating the NF-\\u03baB signaling pathway.\",\n",

The expression of hsa_circ_0003176 was detected by RT-qPCR in NSCLC tissues, paired adjacent nontumor tissues, and cell lines. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractionation analysis was used to detect the subcellular localization of hsa_circ_0003176 in H1299 and A549 cells. Dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assay were used to confirm the regulatory of miR-182-5p to hsa_circ_0003176 and RBM5. The roles of hsa_circ_0003176 in NSCLC progression was evaluated both in vitro by CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, wound-healing assay, and matrigel transwell assay and in vivo by the subcutaneous xenograft nude mouse experiment and lung metastasis nude mouse experiment. In addition, RNA pull down and luciferase reporter assays were carried out to investigate the interaction between hsa_circ_0003176 or RBM5 and miR-182-5p.\\nOur results indicated that hsa_circ_0003176 showed typical characteristic of circRNAs, which was downregulated in both NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Functionally, overexpression of hsa_circ_0003176 suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro and inhibited NSCLC growth and metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, we found that hsa_circ_0003176 acts as sponge of miR-182-5p to regulate RBM5 expression. Further, in vitro rescue experiments demonstrated that hsa_circ_0003176 suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells by regulating miR-182-5p/RBM5 axis.\\nWe demonstrated that hsa_circ_0003176 suppressed the NSCLC progression via regulating miR-182-5p/RBM5 axis.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Previous studies have found that some ventricular remodeling is accompanied by increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in vivo, and MMP-9 inhibitors can reduce ventricular remodeling. However, there is still no direct evidence that MMP-9 causes ventricular remodeling. In this study, MMP-9 was injected into rats to observe whether MMP-9 caused ventricular remodeling, thereby providing direct evidence of MMP-9-induced ventricular remodeling.\\nForty-eight eight-week-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided, by weight, into control, low-, medium-, and high-dose MMP-9 groups and were administered normal saline or recombinant rat MMP-9 0.7, 1.4, or 2.1\\u2009ng/g, respectively, via intraperitoneal injection, twice per week. On the 28th day, six rats were randomly selected from each group (Stage I). The remaining rats continued receiving injections until the 56th day (Stage II). Echocardiography was performed to observe cardiac structure and function, and the left ventricular mass index (LVWI) was calculated. Myocardial pathological changes and the collagen volume fraction (CVF) were observed by HE and VG staining in myocardial tissue. MMP-9 levels in serum were tested using ELISA. Myocardial MMP-9 levels were measured using Western blots, and the myocardial expression levels of MMP-9 mRNA were assessed using RT-PCR.\\nDuring Stage I, serum MMP-9 and myocardial MMP-9 mRNA levels are increased; hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, disorderly arrangement of fibers, and endochylema dissolution are observed in the medium- and high-dose groups. The left ventricular weight index (LVWI) and myocardial MMP-9 increased, and the collagen volume fraction (CVF) reduced in the high-dose group. In Stage II, the left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and diameter (LVIDd) are higher, and CVF decreased in the medium- and high-dose groups. Myocardial pathological lesions intensified. Serum MMP-9 in the model groups and myocardial MMP-9 in the medium- and high-dose groups are increased.\\nInjection of MMP-9 can lead to ventricular remodeling.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Kallikrein-related peptidase 6 (KLK6) has been substantiated as a diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic molecular in several cancer types. In our study, we attempt to explore the biological functions of KLK6 in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA).\\nKLK6 gene expression prognostic, gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and immune infiltration were analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. In vitro and in vivo experimental measurements, including CCK8, transwell migration, TUNEL, and nude mouse transplanted tumor model, were used to evaluate the antineoplastic activities of KLK6 loss-of-function.\\nThe combination of bioinformatics analyses and experimental measurements demonstrate that KLK6 expression is aberrantly upregulated in human specimens and cell lines of BLCA. GO and GSEA enrichment analyses exhibited that KLK6 is implicated in the inflammatory response and immune infiltration, suggesting that upregulation of KLK6 may be associated with the progression of BLCA. Knockdown of KLK6 is able to inhibit the growth and migration and trigger apoptosis of RT4 and T24 cells. Moreover, the TCGA database indicates that KLK6 high expression in BLCA patients showed a poorer prognosis than those patients with KLK6 low expression. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses suggest KLK6 as an independent prognostic factor to predict unfavorable OS in patients with BLCA.\\nKLK6 is an independent prognostic factor and an antitumor target of BLCA. KLK6 expression positively correlates with several immune cells infiltration, indicating that inhibition of KLK6 may contribute to immunotherapy of BLCA.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The endometrium receptivity was impaired by controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), which would then lead to fertility issues and increased abortion clinically. In the present study, to explore the effectiveness of Tiaojing Zhuyun Formula (TJZYF) in improving endometrial receptivity of COH rats and the possible active ingredients and mechanisms, an approach of network pharmacology was performed and a COH animal model was established. As analyzed, stigmasterol and quercetin may be the active ingredients of TJZYF on improving endometrial receptivity and positive regulation of ion transport, the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, and endocrine process, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling pathway may be involved. Eighty female rats were divided into four groups randomly: control, model, TJZYF, and TJZYF+si-VEGFA. COH rat models were constructed by injecting with human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). We found that both endometrial thickness and number of embryo implantations in model were substantially reduced vs. control. The gene and protein expressions of VEGF, PI3K, and p-Akt in the uterus were significantly reduced. TJZYF could increase the endometrial thickness and number of embryo implantations and enhance the expressions of VEGF, PI3K, and p-Akt in the uterus. In the TJZYF+si-VEGFA group, the effect of TJZYF was impaired. Generally, TJZYF could improve the endometrium receptivity and facilitate embryo implantation of COH rats by upregulating VEGF and enhancing the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.\",\n",

Further, PPI network and KEGG enrichment were used to identify the key targets and pathways. Ultimately, these key targets and pathways were validated by in vivo experiments on GAD mice modeled by repeated restraint stress (RRS) and in vitro experiments on inflammatory factor stimulated BV-2 cells.\\nThrough searching the databases, the 137 ingredients of WDD that correspond to 938 targets and 4794 targets related to GAD were identified. Among them, 569 overlapping targets were considered as the therapeutic targets of WDD for GAD. PPI analysis showed that the inflammation-related proteins IL-6, TNF, SRC and AKT1 were the key targets, and KEGG enrichment suggested that PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways were key pathways of WDD in the treatment of GAD. In vivo experiments, RRS mice exhibited abnormality in behavioristics in open field test (OFT) and elevated plus maze (EPM) and increases in serum corticosterone and the percentage of lymphocytes positive for IL-6 in peripheral blood. These abnormal changes can be reversed by WDD and the positive control drug paroxetine. In vitro experiments, WDD can inhibit IL-6 induced activation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways in BV2 cells, and suppress the ensuing release of inflammatory factors TNF-\\u03b1, IL-1\\u03b2 and PGE\\nWDD is able to resist GAD by relieving inflammatory response in peripheral and central system.\",\n",

PCOS is accompanied by many other reproductive, endocrinal, and metabolic disorders thus amassing the difficulties encountered by the women affected. However, there is limited information on its molecular etiology. Synoviolin (SYVN1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is thought to participate in the pathology of PCOS. However, the expression and function of SYVN1 in PCOS are unknown. In this study, we found that downregulation of SYVN1 expression was followed by increased apoptosis in the granulosa cells (GCs) of patients with PCOS. Subsequent in vitro experiments indicated that the overexpression of SYVN1 inhibited apoptosis and mitochondrial fission. Furthermore, using immunoprecipitation and western blotting, we identified that SYVN1 promoted the degradation of Drp1 via the proteasome-dependent pathway. Additionally, we generated a PCOS model in female Sprague Dawley rats and treated them with an SYVN1 inhibitor, LS-102. We observed that the inhibition of SYVN1 increased Drp1 levels and exacerbated the degeneration of GCs in the PCOS rat model. Finally, \",\n",

This study investigated the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in hyperoxia-induced lung injury at very high oxygen levels (>95%).\\nEffects of severe hyperoxia (100% oxygen) were studied in mice with genetically inhibited EGFR and wild-type littermates. Despite the established role of EGFR in lung repair, EGFR inhibition led to improved survival and reduced acute lung injury, which prompted an investigation into this protective mechanism. Endothelial EGFR genetic knockout did not confer protection. EGFR inhibition led to decreased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) and decreased terminal dUTP nick end labeling- (TUNEL-) positive staining in alveolar epithelial cells and reduced ERK activation, which suggested reduced apoptosis \\nIn conditions of severe hyperoxia (>95% for >24\\u2009h), EGFR inhibition led to improved survival, decreased lung injury, and reduced cell death. These findings further elucidate the complex role of EGFR in acute lung injury.\",\n",

Nevertheless, the expression characteristics, biological functions, and regulatory mechanism of circ_0000189 in glioma are unclear.\\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was utilized to detect the expression levels of circ_0000189, miR-192-5p, and ZEB2 mRNA in glioma tissues and cells. The association between the expression of circ_0000189 and the clinicopathological indicators and the features of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of glioma patients were analyzed. Western blot was utilized to evaluate ZEB2 expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT-)-related proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, as well as Vimentin) in glioma cells. Cell proliferation was assessed employing cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and EdU experiments. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptotic rate of the cells. Cell migration and invasion were accessed employing Transwell assay. Moreover, dual luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were employed to investigate the targeting relationship between miR-192-5p and circ_0000189, miR-192-5p, and ZEB2. Subcutaneous tumorigenesis experiment and lung metastasis experiment in nude mice were conducted to verify the regulatory function of circ_0000189 on the proliferation and metastasis of glioma cells \\ncirc_0000189 was markedly overexpressed in glioma tissues and cell lines. Its high expression was associated with poor clinical pathological indicators and adverse MRI signs. Gain-of-function experiments and loss-of-function experiments confirmed that circ_0000189 overexpression facilitated the proliferation and migration, as well as invasion of glioma cells, and suppressed apoptosis, and facilitated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Compared to the control group, knocking down circ_0000189 suppressed the malignant phenotypes of glioma cells \\ncirc_0000189 facilitates the progression of glioma by modulating miR-192-5p/ZEB2 axis.\",\n",

This study evaluated the pro-inflammation activity of LcTLP in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that LcTLP digested in vitro exhibited the pro-inflammation activity in RAW264.7 cells, as evidenced by an increase in pro-inflammation cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1 (TNF-\\u03b1), interleukin-1\\u03b2 (IL-1\\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). After LcTLP supplementation in mice, pathological examination revealed the edematous cytoplasm and inflammatory cell accumulation in liver tissue. The levels of TNF-\\u03b1, IL-1\\u03b2, IL-6 and interleukin-10 in liver also increased by 60.43%, 74.86%, 120.18% and 129.91% in high-dose group, respectively, due to the upregulation of p-p65 and p-p38 levels and further activation of NF-\\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways. Additionally, LcTLP altered the composition of gut microbiota, such as the reduction of Bacteroidota, norank_f__Muribaculaceae and norank_f__Lachnospiraceae abundances which were negatively correlated with inflammation cytokines levels.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"A core symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is repetitive and restrictive patterns of behavior. Cognitive inflexibility has been proposed as a potential basis for these symptoms of ASD. More generally, behavioral inflexibility has been proposed to underlie repetitive and restrictive behavior in ASD. Here, we investigated whether and how behavioral flexibility is compromised in a widely used animal model of ASD.\\nWe compared the behavioral performance of Shank2-knockout mice and wild-type littermates in reversal learning employing a probabilistic classical trace conditioning paradigm. A conditioned stimulus (odor) was paired with an unconditioned appetitive (water, 6\\u00a0\\u00b5l) or aversive (air puff) stimulus in a probabilistic manner. We also compared air puff-induced eye closure responses of Shank2-knockout and wild-type mice.\\nMale, but not female, Shank2-knockout mice showed impaired reversal learning when the expected outcomes consisted of a water reward and a strong air puff. Moreover, male, but not female, Shank2-knockout mice showed stronger anticipatory eye closure responses to the air puff compared to wild-type littermates, raising the possibility that the impairment might reflect enhanced fear. In support of this contention, male Shank2-knockout mice showed intact reversal learning when the strong air puff was replaced with a mild air puff and when the expected outcomes consisted of only rewards.\\nWe examined behavioral flexibility in one behavioral task (reversal learning in a probabilistic classical trace conditioning paradigm) using one ASD mouse model (Shank2-knockout mice). Thus, future work is needed to clarify the extent to which our findings (that enhanced fear limits behavioral flexibility in ASD) can explain the behavioral inflexibility associated with ASD. Also, we examined only the relationship between fear and behavioral flexibility, leaving open the question of whether abnormalities in processes other than fear contribute to behavioral inflexibility in ASD. Finally, the neurobiological mechanisms linking Shank2-knockout and enhanced fear remain to be elucidated.\\nOur results indicate that enhanced fear suppresses reversal learning in the presence of an intact capability to learn cue-outcome contingency changes in Shank2-knockout mice. Our findings suggest that behavioral flexibility might be seriously limited by abnormal emotional responses in ASD.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become a global medical problem. Currently, there is no approved pharmacologic treatment for this condition. Previous studies have suggested that in the pathogenesis of this disease, regulatory pathways associated with de novo lipogenesis and \\u03b2-oxidation pathways genes are misregulated. Capparis spinosa (CS) belongs to the family of Capparidaceae and is a traditional plant used to treat various diseases, particularly dyslipidemia. The compounds and extracts of this plant in In vivo and in vitro studies resulted in a reduction in lipid profiles and glucose. However, the mechanism of these effects remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of (CS) fruit extract on NASH compared to fenofibrate and explored the related molecular mechanism.\\nIn the rats (n\\u2009=\\u200940) model of NASH, biochemical and histopathological examinations showed that liver steatosis, inflammation, and hepatic fibrosis were markedly attenuated in response to CS and fenofibrate interventions. At the molecular level, CS treatment down-regulated sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and up-regulated Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) expression (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). In conclusion, CS has favorable therapeutic effects for NASH, which was associated with ameliorating steatosis and fibrosis via regulation of the DNL and \\u03b2-oxidation pathway genes.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In vivo gene editing of somatic cells with CRISPR nucleases has facilitated the generation of autochthonous mouse tumors, which are initiated by genetic alterations relevant to the human disease and progress along a natural timeline as in patients. However, the long and variable, orthotopic tumor growth in inner organs requires sophisticated, time-consuming and resource-intensive imaging for longitudinal disease monitoring and impedes the use of autochthonous tumor models for preclinical studies.\\nTo facilitate a more widespread use, we have generated a reporter mouse that expresses a Cre-inducible luciferase from Gaussia princeps (GLuc), which is secreted by cells in an energy-consuming process and can be measured quantitatively in the blood as a marker for the viable tumor load. In addition, we have developed a flexible, complementary toolkit to rapidly assemble recombinant adenoviruses (AVs) for delivering Cre recombinase together with CRISPR nucleases targeting cancer driver genes.\\nWe demonstrate that intratracheal infection of GLuc reporter mice with CRISPR-AVs efficiently induces lung tumors driven by mutations in the targeted cancer genes and simultaneously activates the GLuc transgene, resulting in GLuc secretion into the blood by the growing tumor. GLuc blood levels are easily and robustly quantified in small-volume blood samples with inexpensive equipment, enable tumor detection already several months before the humane study endpoint and precisely mirror the kinetics of tumor development specified by the inducing gene combination.\\nOur study establishes blood-based GLuc monitoring as an inexpensive, rapid, high-throughput and animal-friendly method to longitudinally monitor autochthonous tumor growth in preclinical studies.\",\n",

However, the function and molecular mechanism of circ_0000808 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still unclear.\\nQuantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of circ_0000808, miR-1827, and solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5). Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were measured by cell counting kit 8 assay, colony formation assay, EdU staining, flow cytometry, wound healing assay, and transwell assay. The protein expression was measured by Western blot analysis. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay were used to investigate the interactions between miR-1827 and circ_0000808 or SLC1A5. Cell glutamine metabolism was assessed by determining glutamine uptake, glutamate production, and \\u03b1-ketoglutarate production. Xenograft mouse model was used to assess the in vivo effects of circ_0000808.\\nCirc_0000808 expression was upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cancer cells, and its silencing inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and led to apoptosis. Further results confirmed that circ_0000808 interacted with miR-1827 to positively regulate SLC1A5. The rescue experiments showed that miR-1827 inhibitor reversed the suppressive effect of circ_0000808 knockdown on the malignant behaviors of NSCLC cells. Also, SLC1A5 overexpression abolished the inhibition effect of miR-1827 on NSCLC cell progression. In addition, circ_0000808/miR-1827/SLC1A5 axis positively regulated the glutamine metabolism process in NSCLC cells. Moreover, circ_0000808 knockdown reduced the NSCLC tumor growth in vivo.\\nIn summary, our data showed that circ_0000808 enhanced the progression of NSCLC by promoting glutamine metabolism through the miR-1827/SLC1A5 axis.\",\n",

The rescue experiments showed that miR-1827 inhibitor reversed the suppressive effect of circ_0000808 knockdown on the malignant behaviors of NSCLC cells. Also, SLC1A5 overexpression abolished the inhibition effect of miR-1827 on NSCLC cell progression.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Stent implantation-induced neointima formation is a dominant culprit in coronary artery disease treatment failure after percutaneous coronary intervention. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent regulated cell death, has been associated with various cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of ferroptosis on neointima formation remains unclear.\\nThe mouse common right carotid arteries were ligated for 16 or 30\\u00a0days, and ligated tissues were collected for further analyses. Primary rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were isolated from the media of aortas of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and used for in vitro cell culture experiments.\\nFerroptosis was positively associated with neointima formation. In vivo, RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3), a ferroptosis activator, aggravated carotid artery ligation-induced neointima formation and promoted VSMC phenotypic conversion. In contrast, a ferroptosis inhibitor, ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), showed the opposite effects in mice. In vitro, RSL3 promoted rat VSMC phenotypic switching from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype, evidenced by increased contractile markers (smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and calponin 1), and decreased synthetic marker osteopontin. The induction of ferroptosis by RSL3 was confirmed by the increased expression level of ferroptosis-associated gene prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2). The effect of RSL3 on rat VSMC phenotypic switching was abolished by Fer-1. Moreover, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), the reactive oxygen species inhibitor, counteracted the effect of RSL3 on the phenotypic conversion of rat VSMCs.\\nFerroptosis induces VSMC phenotypic switching and accelerates ligation-induced neointimal hyperplasia in mice. Our findings suggest inhibition of ferroptosis as an attractive strategy for limiting vascular restenosis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a heterogeneous group of inflammatory diseases affecting joints with a prevalence of one in a thousand children. There is a growing body of literature examining the use of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MPCs) for the treatment of adult and childhood arthritis, however, we still lack a clear understanding of how these MPC populations are impacted by arthritic disease states and how this could influence treatment efficacy. In the current study we examined the immunophenotyping, self-renewal ability and chondrogenic capacity (in vitro and in vivo) of synovial derived MPCs from normal, JIA and RA joints. Synovial MPCs from JIA patients demonstrated reduced self-renewal ability and chondrogenic differentiation capacity. Furthermore, they did not induce cartilage regeneration when xenotransplanted in a mouse cartilage injury model. Synovial MPCs from JIA patients are functionally compromised compared to MPCs from normal and/or RA joints. The molecular mechanisms behind this loss of function remain elusive. Further study is required to see if these cells can be re-functionalized and used in cell therapy strategies for these JIA patients, or if allogenic approaches should be considered.\",\n",

We recently demonstrated that siRNA chemical architectures can be optimized to provide efficient delivery to the CNS, enabling development of CNS-targeted therapeutics. Many genetically-defined neurodegenerative disorders are dominant, favoring selective silencing of the mutant allele. In some cases, successfully targeting the mutant allele requires targeting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heterozygosities. Here, we use Huntington's disease (HD) as a model. The optimized compound exhibits selective silencing of mutant huntingtin protein in patient-derived cells and throughout the HD mouse brain, demonstrating SNP-based allele-specific RNAi silencing of gene expression in vivo in the CNS. Targeting a disease-causing allele using RNAi-based therapies could be helpful in a range of dominant CNS disorders where maintaining wild-type expression is essential.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"MLN4924 is a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE), which is currently in several clinical trials for anti-cancer applications. However, MLN4924 also showed some off-target effects with potential to promote the growth of cancer cells which counteracts its anticancer activity. In this study, we found that MLN4924 increases the levels of PD-L1 mRNA and protein in dose- and time-dependent manners. Mechanistic study showed that this MLN4924 effect is largely independent of neddylation inactivation, but is due to activation of both ERK and JNK signals, leading to AP-1 activation, which is blocked by the small molecule inhibitors of MEK and JNK, respectively. Biologically, MLN4924 attenuates T cell killing in a co-culture model due to PD-L1 upregulation, which can be, at least in part, abrogated by either MEK inhibitor or anti-PD-L1 antibody. In an in vivo BALB/c mouse xenograft tumor model, while MLN4924 alone had no effect, combination with either MEK inhibitor or anti-PD-L1 antibody enhanced the suppression of tumor growth. Taken together, our study provides a sound rationale for effective anticancer therapy in combination of anti-PD-L1 antibody or MEK inhibitor with MLN4924 to overcome the side-effect of immunosuppression by MLN4924 via PD-L1 induction.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Current immunotherapies still have limited successful rates among cancers. It is now recognized that T cell functional state in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key determinant for effective antitumor immunity and immunotherapy. In addition to exhaustion, cellular senescence in tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) has recently been identified as an important T cell dysfunctional state induced by various malignant tumors. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for T cell senescence in the TME and development of novel strategies to prevent effector T cell senescence are urgently needed for cancer immunotherapy.\\nSenescent T cell populations in the TMEs in mouse lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma tumor models were evaluated. Furthermore, T cell senescence induced by mouse tumor and regulatory T (Treg) cells in vitro was determined with multiple markers and assays, including real-time PCR, flow cytometry, and histochemistry staining. Loss-of-function strategies with pharmacological inhibitors and the knockout mouse model were used to identify the potential molecules and pathways involved in T cell senescence. In addition, melanoma mouse tumor immunotherapy models were performed to explore the synergistical efficacy of antitumor immunity via prevention of tumor-specific T cell senescence combined with anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) checkpoint blockade therapy.\\nWe report that both mouse malignant tumor cells and Treg cells can induce responder T cell senescence, similar as shown in human Treg and tumor cells. Accumulated senescent T cells also exist in the TME in tumor models of lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. Induction of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM)-associated DNA damage is the cause for T cell senescence induced by both mouse tumor cells and Treg cells, which is also regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Furthermore, blockages of ATM-associated DNA damage and/or MAPK signaling pathways in T cells can prevent T cell senescence mediated by tumor cells and Treg cells in vitro and enhance antitumor immunity and immunotherapy in vivo in adoptive transfer T cell therapy melanoma models. Importantly, prevention of tumor-specific T cell senescence via ATM and/or MAPK signaling inhibition combined with anti-PD-L1 checkpoint blockade can synergistically enhance antitumor immunity and immunotherapy in vivo.\\nThese studies prove the novel concept that targeting both effector T cell senescence and exhaustion is an effective strategy and can synergistically enhance cancer immunotherapy.\",\n",

Accumulated senescent T cells also exist in the TME in tumor models of lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. Induction of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM)-associated DNA damage is the cause for T cell senescence induced by both mouse tumor cells and Treg cells, which is also regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Furthermore, blockages of ATM-associated DNA damage and/or MAPK signaling pathways in T cells can prevent T cell senescence mediated by tumor cells and Treg cells in vitro and enhance antitumor immunity and immunotherapy in vivo in adoptive transfer T cell therapy melanoma models. Importantly, prevention of tumor-specific T cell senescence via ATM and/or MAPK signaling inhibition combined with anti-PD-L1 checkpoint blockade can synergistically enhance antitumor immunity and immunotherapy in vivo.\",\n",

However, a comparison of connectivity studies in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) reveals that the average number and strength of connections between specific neuron types can vary. Can variability in V1 connectivity measurements coexist with canonical neural computations? We developed a theory-driven approach to deduce V1 network connectivity from visual responses in mouse V1 and visual thalamus (dLGN). Our method revealed that the same recorded visual responses were captured by multiple connectivity configurations. Remarkably, the magnitude and selectivity of connectivity weights followed a specific order across most of the inferred connectivity configurations. We argue that this order stems from the specific shapes of the recorded contrast response functions and contrast invariance of orientation tuning. Remarkably, despite variability across connectivity studies, connectivity weights computed from individual published connectivity reports followed the order we identified with our method, suggesting that the relations between the weights, rather than their magnitudes, represent a connectivity motif supporting canonical V1 computations.\",\n",

It has been demonstrated that the primary molecular determinant of virulence phenotype is located in the 5' UTR of the viral genome. Translation initiation of CVB3 RNA is directed by the IRES element situated in the 5'UTR. In the present study, we analyse the effects of single point mutations introduced in different positions in the domain V of the IRES RNA of CVB3 wild type. We characterize in vitro virus replicative capacitiy and translation efficiency and we test in vivo virulence of different CVB3 mutants produced by the introduction of different mutations in the domain V of IRES by site-directed mutagenesis to abolish its structure. Our results demonstrate that all RNA mutants display different levels of decreased replication and translation initiation efficiency in vitro. The translation defect was correlated with significant reduced viral titer of mutant particles in comparison with the wild type. When inoculated in mice, mutant viruses were checked for inflammation and necrosis.In vitro and in vivo Findings strongly suggest that the most attenuated mutant strain could be considered a candidate for live-attenuated CVB3 vaccine.\",\n",

Increased mitochondrial oxidative stress has been suggested as a mechanism resulting in GEC dysfunction in the pathogenesis of some glomerular diseases. Historically the isolation of GECs from in vivo models has been notoriously challenging due to difficulties in isolating pure cultures from glomeruli. GECs have complex growth requirements in vitro and a very limited lifespan. Here, we describe the procedure for isolating and culturing conditionally immortalized GECs with fluorescent mitochondria, enabling the tracking of mitochondrial fission and fusion events. GECs were isolated from the kidneys of a double transgenic mouse expressing the thermolabile SV40 TAg (from the Immortomouse), conditionally promoting proliferation and suppressing cell differentiation, and a photo-convertible fluorescent protein (Dendra2) in all mitochondria (from the photo-activatable mitochondria [PhAM\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Nephron endowment is defined by fetal kidney growth and crucially dictates renal health in adults. Defects in the molecular regulation of nephron progenitors contribute to only a fraction of reduced nephron mass cases, suggesting alternative causative mechanisms. The importance of MAPK/ERK activation in nephron progenitor maintenance has been previously demonstrated, and here, we characterized the metabolic consequences of MAPK/ERK deficiency. Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabolomics profiling identified 42 reduced metabolites, of which 26 were supported by in vivo transcriptional changes in MAPK/ERK-deficient nephron progenitors. Among these, mitochondria, ribosome and amino acid metabolism, together with diminished pyruvate and proline metabolism, were the most affected pathways. In vitro cultures of mouse kidneys demonstrated a dosage-specific function for pyruvate in controlling the shape of the ureteric bud tip, a regulatory niche for nephron progenitors. In vivo disruption of proline metabolism caused premature nephron progenitor exhaustion through their accelerated differentiation in pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductases 1 (Pycr1) and 2 (Pycr2) double-knockout kidneys. Pycr1/Pycr2-deficient progenitors showed normal cell survival, indicating no changes in cellular stress. Our results suggest that MAPK/ERK-dependent metabolism functionally participates in nephron progenitor maintenance by monitoring pyruvate and proline biogenesis in developing kidneys.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) is characterized by recurrent fevers and flares of systemic inflammation, caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in MVK. The underlying disease mechanisms and triggers of inflammatory flares are poorly understood because of the lack of in vivo models. We describe genetically modified mice bearing the hypomorphic mutation p.Val377Ile (the commonest variant in patients with MKD) and amorphic, frameshift mutations in Mvk. Compound heterozygous mice recapitulated the characteristic biochemical phenotype of MKD, with increased plasma mevalonic acid and clear buildup of unprenylated GTPases in PBMCs, splenocytes, and bone marrow. The inflammatory response to LPS was enhanced in compound heterozygous mice and treatment with the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 prevented the elevation of circulating IL-1\\u03b2, thus identifying a potential inflammasome target for future therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, lines of mice with a range of deficiencies in mevalonate kinase and abnormal prenylation mirrored the genotype-phenotype relationship in human MKD. Importantly, these mice allowed the determination of a threshold level of residual enzyme activity, below which protein prenylation is impaired. Elevated temperature dramatically but reversibly exacerbated the deficit in the mevalonate pathway and the defective prenylation in vitro and in vivo, highlighting increased body temperature as a likely trigger of inflammatory flares.\",\n",

Renal macrophages play a key role in the pathogenesis (M1 subpopulation), healing and remodeling (M2 subpopulation) in AKI and, thus, have been a promising target for clinical treatment of AKI. Here, in a mouse renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) model for AKI, we showed that renal macrophages could be further classified into Clec7a+ M1 macrophages, Clec7a- M1 macrophages, Clec7a+ M2 macrophages and Clec7a- M2 macrophages, representing distinct macrophage populations with different functionality. Interestingly, Clec7a+ M1 macrophages exhibited potent pro-inflammatory and phagocytic effects compared to Clec7a- M1 macrophages, while Clec7a- M2 macrophages exhibited better proliferating and migrating potential, which is critical for their role in tissue repairing after injury. These data from mice were further strengthened by bioinformatics analyses using published database. \",\n",

Here, the tumor cells were genetically modified to achieve an inducible overexpression of the N-terminal domain of gasdermin D (GSDMD-NT) and effectively cause pyroptosis under a strict control. Pyroptotic tumor cells release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and inflammatory cytokines to promote the maturation and migration of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Furthermore, local tumor delivery, and preventive or therapeutic subcutaneous immunization of the modified cells, followed by the induction of GSDMD-NT expression, significantly stimulated both the systemic and local responses of antitumor immunity, and reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment, leading to the dramatic suppression of tumor growth in mice. This study has explored the application potency of inducing the pyroptosis of tumor cells in the field of tumor immunotherapy, especially for developing a new and promising personalized tumor vaccine.\",\n",

The specific role of NRAV and miR-299-3p in cell proliferation and transfer potential was evaluated by cell formation analysis, Cell Counting Kit-8 and Transwell analysis. The relationship between NRAV and miR-299-3p was studied by predictive bioinformatics, RNA immunoassay, and fluorescence enzyme analysis. \\nThe expression level of lncRNA NRAV was higher in both tumor tissues and cell lines of PDAC and was negatively associated with the clinical survival of PDAC patients. Functionally, overexpression of NRAV promoted cell proliferation and metastasis of PDAC cells, while knockdown of NRAV reversed these effects. Finally, NRAV was performed as a molecular sponge of miR-299-3p. Moreover, overexpression of miR-299-3p could reverse the promoting effects of NRAV on cell proliferation and metastasis of PDAC cells.\\nNRAV facilitates progression of PDAC as a molecular sponge of miR-299-3p and may be a potential molecular marker for diagnosis and treatment of PDAC.\",\n",

Glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis results in significant morbidity and mortality but the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying GC-induced bone loss are not clear. GC use results in decreased osteoblast differentiation with increased marrow adiposity through effects on bone marrow stem cells. GC effects are transduced through its receptor (GR). To identify novel GR regulated genes, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis comparing conditional GR knockout mouse made by crossing the floxed GR animal with the Col I promoter-Cre, versus normal floxed GR without Cre, and that testing was specific for Col I promoter active cells, such as bone marrow mesenchymal stem/osteoprogenitor cells (MSCs) and osteoblasts. Results showed 15 upregulated genes (3- to 10-fold) and 70 downregulated genes (-2.7- to -10-fold), with the long noncoding RNA X-inactive specific transcript (\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play many important roles in gene regulation and disease pathogenesis. Here, we sought to determine that mitochondrial dynamic related lncRNA (MDRL) modulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and protects arteries against atherosclerosis.\\nDownregulated MDRL and increased NLRP3 were observed in mouse atherosclerotic plaques, accompanied with the increase of miR-361. The results showed that MDRL overexpression significantly attenuated the burden of atherosclerotic plaque and facilitated plaque stability through inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and cell apoptosis, and vice versa. Mechanically, MDRL suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and VSMC apoptosis via suppressing miR-361. Furthermore, miR-361 directly bound to the 3'UTR of SQSTM1 and inhibited its translation, subsequently activating NLRP3 inflammasome. Systematic delivery of miR-361 partly counteracted the beneficial effects of MDRL overexpression on atherosclerotic development in LDLR\\nIn summary, MDRL alleviates NLRP3 inflammasome activation and apoptosis in VSMCs through miR-361/SQSTM1/NLRP3 pathway during atherogenesis. These data indicate that MDRL and inhibition of miR-361 represent potential therapeutic targets in atherosclerosis-related diseases.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The wide application of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) in industry, agriculture, environmental remediation, and biomedicine has increased the risk of human exposure to CuO NPs. Recent studies suggested that CuO NPs have genotoxic and cytotoxic effects on various cells. However, little is known about the toxicity of CuO NPs on major peripheral organs after respiratory exposure.\\nWe investigated the toxicities of CuO NPs on human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) and human cardiomyocytes (AC16) cells in vitro, and on the lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) at 24 and 72 h after intrabronchial instillation in vivo.\\nCuO NPs induced concentration-dependent toxicities in both BEAS-2B and AC16 cells mainly through hierarchical oxidative stress mechanisms, involving generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), mitochondrial dysfunction, and secretion of proinflammatory and profibrogenic cytokines. Respiratory exposure to CuO NPs induced acute multiple organ injuries in SHRs manifesting through inflammation and fibrosis. However, cardiac injury was relatively less severe than injuries in the lungs, liver, and kidneys. Upregulation of serum C-reaction protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor \\u03b1 (TNF-\\u03b1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), endothelin-1 (ET-1), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) after exposure to CuO NPs indicated systematic inflammation, endothelial injury, and potential prothrombosis.\\nRespiratory exposure to CuO NPs induced acute injuries in main peripheral organs, including the lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart. Individuals with existing cardiovascular diseases were susceptible to exposure to CuO NPs. This study provides a warning about the extensive toxic effects of CuO NPs, especially in the susceptible population.\",\n",

Ferroptosis is a newly discovered type of cell death resulting from iron-dependent lipid peroxide accumulation. The purpose of this study was to examine whether ferroptosis is involved in COPD-associated skeletal muscle dysfunction.\\nA mouse model of COPD was established after 24 weeks of cigarette smoke (CS) exposure, and mRNA sequencing, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, immunostaining (IF), RT-PCR, and Western blot were utilized to identify the changes in gastrocnemius muscles. In vitro, C2C12 myotubes were treated with CS extract (CSE) and evaluated for ferroptosis-related molecules. The pathways regulating ferroptosis were then explored in CSE-stimulated myotubes.\\nCompared with controls, COPD mice showed an enriched ferroptosis pathway. \\nCS exposure induced ferroptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, CS-exposure upregulated MSTN which further induced ferroptosis through HIF2\\u03b1 in skeletal muscles, which may contribute to muscle dysfunction through impairing metabolic capacity and decreasing muscle fiber numbers, revealing a potential novel therapeutic target for COPD-related skeletal muscle dysfunction.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"A well-orchestrated program of oocyte growth and differentiation results in a developmentally competent oocyte. In late oogenesis, germinal vesicle oocytes (GVOs) undergo chromatin remodeling accompanied by transcriptional silencing from an NSN (non-surrounded nucleolus) to an SN (surrounded nucleolus) chromatin state. By analyzing different cytoplasmic and nuclear characteristics, our results indicate that murine NSN-GVOs transition via an intermediate stage into SN-GVOs in vivo. Interestingly, this transition can also be observed ex vivo, including most characteristics seen in vivo, which allows to analyze this transition process in more detail. The nuclear rearrangements during the transition are accompanied by changes in DNA methylation and Tet enzyme-catalyzed DNA modifications. Early parthenogenetic embryos, derived from NSN-GVOs, show lower DNA methylation levels than SN-derived embryos. Together, our data suggest that a successful NSN-SN transition in oogenesis including proper DNA methylation remodeling is important for the establishment of a developmentally competent oocyte for the beginning of life.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an extremely rare, aggressive tumor with few effective therapeutic options or drugs. Mitotane (Mtn), which is the only authorized therapeutic drug, came out in 1970 and is still the only first-line treatment for ACC in spite of serious adverse reaction and a high recurrence rate.\\nBy in silico analysis of the ACC dataset in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), we determined that high expression levels of cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) were significantly related to the adverse clinical outcomes of ACC. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to evaluate the role of CDK1 in ACC progression through gain and loss of function assays in ACC cells. CDK1 inhibitors were screened to identify potential candidates for the treatment of ACC. RNA sequencing, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence assays were used to elucidate the mechanism.\\nOverexpression of CDK1 in ACC cell lines promoted proliferation and induced the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas knockdown of CDK1 expression inhibited growth of ACC cell lines. The CDK1 inhibitor, cucurbitacin E (CurE), had the best inhibitory effect with good time-and dose-dependent activity both in vitro and in vivo. CurE had a greater inhibitory effect on ACC xenografts in nude mice than mitotane, without obvious adverse effects. Most importantly, combined treatment with CurE and mitotane almost totally eliminated ACC tumors. With respect to mechanism, CDK1 facilitated the EMT of ACC cells via Slug and Twist and locked ACC cells into the G2/M checkpoint through interaction with UBE2C and AURKA/B. CDK1 also regulated pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis (PANoptosis) of ACC cells through binding with the PANoptosome in a ZBP1-dependent way.\\nCDK1 could be exploited as an essential therapeutic target of ACC via regulating the EMT, the G2/M checkpoint, and PANoptosis. Thus, CurE may be a potential candidate drug for ACC therapy with good safety and efficacy, which will meet the great need of patients with ACC.\",\n",

Application of rapidly evolving genetic tools, such as optogenetic/chemogenetic actuators and fluorescent reporters to elucidate the function of cell subtypes in vivo necessitates cell-type specific promoters or enhancers. In this context, methods for genome-wide functional screening of cis-regulatory elements, including enhancers, are of utmost importance. In this study, we describe a novel method for genome-wide functional screening of enhancer activity in vivo with minimal handling. Application of the method to cells from different brain structures and subsequent differential analysis allow identification of active enhancers in the target tissue or brain structures. To demonstrate proof of concept, we applied this method to samples from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the medial prefrontal cortex of the mouse brain and successfully identified six enhancers with highly biased activity towards the dorsal raphe nucleus. Considering that these two structures consist of largely similar cell types whereas serotonin and dopamine neurons exist only in the DRN, our results confirm the validity of this method in identifying cell-type specific and brain-structure specific enhancers. Overall, this method will be helpful in identifying cis-regulatory elements suitable for cell-type specific manipulations.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Curculigoside (Cur) is a natural component from Curculigo orchioides Gaertn, with various bioactivities. The function of Cur in the nervous system and osteoarthritis has been reported. However, its role in osteosarcoma (OS) needs to be investigated. Hence, we focus on probing the impact of Cur on OS. In vitro, cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry and Transwell assay were used to investigate the effects of Cur on OS cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. In vivo, we developed a xenograft model to figure out the effect of Cur on tumor growth in nude mice. Western blotting (WB) was conducted to compare the levels of Cur on apoptosis-related proteins (C-caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins (N-cadherin, Snail, and E-cadherin) and the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and nuclear factor-\\u03baB (NF-\\u03baB) pathways in vitro and in vivo. In-vitro data testified that Cur treatment markedly hampered OS cells' growth, migration and invasion and intensified their apoptosis compared to that of the control group. In vivo, Cur treatment notably hampered the growth of OS tumors in mice. In addition, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, and NF-\\u03baB were inhibited through Cur treatment. Furthermore, the inhibition of Cur in OS cells was demonstrated by up-regulating the expression of JAK/STAT and NF-\\u03baB pathways protein levels. In summary, the data suggest that Cur curbs OS growth by down-regulating the JAK/STAT and NF-\\u03baB pathways, which is an underlying therapeutic option for OS treatment.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In this study, we investigated the effects of ingested water volume on the oral absorption of fenofibrate (FEN) with several formulations to confirm the applicability of rats for oral formulation screening. Oral absorption of suspended crystalline FEN was significantly improved by increasing ingested water volume (from 0.5 to 2\\u2009mL). FEN absorption improvement by particle size reduction and the linearity in oral absorption by dose escalation suggested that the rate-limiting step of FEN absorption in rats was the dissolution rate, consistent with that in humans. When FEN, as an amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) formulation, was suspended in water followed by immediate administration, oral FEN absorption was significantly higher than when administered in crystalline form and was not influenced by the differences in ingested water volume. Oral absorption of FEN from encapsulated ASD formulation in 1 or 2\\u2009mL of water was comparable with that of the suspension form. However, 0.5\\u2009mL of water significantly reduced the oral absorption of the solid ASD FEN formulation. These results indicate that to improve the oral absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs when performing a preclinical study with rats, 1\\u2009mL of water is the minimum preferable ingested volume to evaluate in vivo formulation performance.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Circular RNA (circRNAs) Fibronectin Type III Domain Containing 3B (FNDC3B) (circFNDC3B) has been revealed to be involved in the progression of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Hence, the potential regulatory network of circFNDC3B in ESCC was further investigated. Levels of genes and proteins were examined by qRT-PCR and Western blot. In vitro assays were performed using colony formation assay, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, flow cytometry, wound healing assay, and transwell assay. The target relationship between miR-214-3p and circFNDC3B or cell division cycle 25 homologue A (CDC25A) was verified by dual-luciferase reporter and RIP assays. In vivo assay was carried out using the xenograft nude mice model. CircFNDC3B was highly expressed in ESCC, and high circFNDC3B expression was tightly associated with poor prognosis in ESCC patients. Functionally, circFNDC3B knockdown not only suppressed ESCC cell growth, migration and invasion in vitro, but hindered ESCC tumour growth in vivo. Mechanistically, circFNDC3B acted as a sponge for miR-214-3p to up-regulate the expression of its target CDC25A. Rescue experiments showed that miR-214-3p inhibitor reversed the anticancer effects of circFNDC3B knockdown. Moreover, forced expression of miR-214-3p suppressed the malignant phenotypes mentioned above, while this condition was abolished by CDC25A overexpression. CircFNDC3B silencing restrains the tumorigenesis of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma through miR-214-3p/CDC25A axis, which opens a new window to the development of novel therapeutic strategy for ESCC patients.\",\n",

Liver microsomes from human (HLMs), Beagle dog (DLMs), minipig (PLMs), monkey (MLMs), rabbit (RLMs), rat (RAMs), and mouse (MIMs) were used to investigate metabolic diversity among different species. Additionally, recombinant human supersomes were used to confirm that metabolic enzymes are involved in the biotransformation of mulberrin. We also evaluated the influence of mulberrin on protein expression by Western blot analysis. Mulberrin metabolism showed significant interspecies differences. We found four and two metabolites in phase I and II reaction systems, respectively. In phase I metabolism profiles of mulberrin for HLMs, PLMs and MLMs conformed to the classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics, RAMs and MIMs followed biphasic kinetics; phase II reaction of mulberrin in HLMs, DLMs, PLMs, MLMs, RLMs, RAMs and MIMs followed biphasic kinetics. UGT1A1 were the major CYP isoforms responsible for the metabolism of mulberrin. Mulberrin showed potent inhibitory effects against CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, UGT1A1, UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 with IC\",\n",

We explored the protective effect of direct administration of COS on intestinal barrier function using an in vivo colitis mouse model and an in vitro enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)-challenged IPEC-J2 cell model. COS directly enhanced the intestinal barrier function. COS intervention also promoted the abundance and diversity of intestinal flora. Importantly, FMT intervention with a COS-derived microbiome decreased the disease index level and alleviated histopathological changes, and improved gut barrier function in the colitis model. Both COS and COS-derived microbiota suppressed ETEC-induced cellular apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells. This study firstly confirms transplantation of COS-modified fecal microbiota can enhance the intestinal barrier function. The mechanism underlying COS benefits is due to a direct intervention by COS supplementation and an indirect improvement of the gut microbiota induced by COS exposure.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"According to the global mapping of dry eye disease (DED), nearly 5 to 50\\u202f% of people suffer from DED, and this number is on the rise. The drug of choice Cyclosporine A (CsA) exhibits poor ocular bioavailability due to high molecular weight and lipophilicity. Moreover, formulations of CsA currently available are in the form of oil-based emulsions that are known to cause ocular irritation and pain. In this study, sulfobutylether-\\u03b2-cyclodextrin (SBE-\\u03b2-CD) based binary and ternary supramolecular complexes of CsA were developed as completely oil-free, and particle-free eye drops to treat DED. The physicochemical characterizations were supplemented with relevant in silico studies, to ascertain the findings. Further, the efficacy of the complexes was evaluated in the scopolamine-induced mouse model of DED. The complexation improved the CsA solubility by ~21-fold, with ~4-fold improvement in dissolution and transcorneal permeation. The non-irritancy and non-toxicity were confirmed by hen's egg chorioallantoic membrane assay and cytotoxicity assay using human corneal epithelial cells, respectively. The in vivo treatment with the ternary CD complex demonstrated better management of the dry eye supported by the tear volume assessment, corneal fluorescein staining, and histopathological studies of the cornea, lacrimal gland, and harderian gland. The study demonstrates the potential of the supramolecular complex as an alternative to the oil-based formulation of eye drops for drugs that show low solubility and poor corneal permeation.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a highly metastatic bone cancer that usually affects children. Rhizoma Paridis saponins (RPS) have been identified to show a broad-spectrum anti-tumor activity. Our previous study has identified vasculogenic mimicry (VM) as an indicator of poor prognosis for OS. Rhizoma Paridis ethanol extract exhibits potent anti-OS property. However, the anti-metastatic effect of RPS on OS and the detailed mechanisms remain unknown. RPS was characterized by liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/Q-TOF/MS) analysis. The anti-OS, anti-metastasis and anti-VM activities of RPS were investigated using in\\u00a0vitro biological assays and a xenograft mouse model. Western blot, qRT-PCR, ELISA, Phalloidin staining and immunohistochemistry assays were conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism of RPS. A total of 34 phytochemicals from RPS were identified by LC/Q-TOF/MS. RPS dose-dependently suppressed the OS cell proliferation, metastasis and VM formation in\\u00a0vitro and in\\u00a0vivo. Mechanically, we found that RPS downregulated migration-inducing gene 7 (MIG-7) expression, resulting in inhibition of the PI3K/MMPs/Ln-5\\u03b32 pathway and cell protrusion formation. Additionally, we confirmed that RPS downregulated MIG-7 by upregulating miR-520d-3p expression. Our results suggests that RPS inhibits the VM formation and metastasis of OS by modulating the miR-520d-3p/MIG-7 signaling axis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of nonapoptotic cell death characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxides in cells. In recent years, extensive attention has been dedicated to exploring safe and effective natural ferroptosis regulators which can provide novel treatment strategies for ferroptosis-related diseases. This study identified galangin, a natural flavonoid, as an effective inhibitor of ferroptosis, which could increase cell viability in RSL3-inhibited HT1080 cells, decrease levels of lipid ROS and MDA, improve PTGS2 mRNA expression, and enhance the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Ferroptosis is widely present in ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. This study found that galangin significantly ameliorated the pathological damage of liver tissue in mice with IR, reduced levels of serum ALT, AST, and MDA, and increased the expression of GPX4. The results of RNA-seq exhibited ferroptosis was significant and the PI3K/AKT pathway deserved to explore the inhibition effects of galangin on ferroptosis. Indeed, galangin treatment significantly rescued RSL3-inhibited phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and CREB proteins, and the ferroptosis inhibitory effects of galangin were counteracted by PI3K inhibitor LY294002. These findings indicated that galangin may exert its anti-ferroptosis effects via activating the PI3K/AKT/CREB signaling pathway and it will hopefully serve as a promising effective measure to attenuate IR injury by inhibiting ferroptosis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In the present study, two prospective Salmonella delivery strains, JOL2782 and JOL2837, were developed by gene deletions of lon and cpxR, which are related to cellular adhesion and intracellular survival. Additionally, sifA deletion was introduced for JOL2782, which confers immune susceptibility and improves antigen delivery. Similarly, the rfaL deletion and lpxE substitution for pagL were accomplished in JOL2837 to reduce virulence and endotoxicity. Thus, enhanced adhesion and invasion and reduced intracellular survival were attained. Furthermore, aspartic acid auxotrophic (asd) was deleted to impose Darwinian selection on retention of the foreign antigen-expressing plasmid. Both delivery strains induced sufficient cytokine expression, but the level was significantly lower than that of the wild-type strain; the lowest cytokine expression was induced by the JOL2837 strain, indicating reduced endotoxicity. In parallel, IgG production was significantly enhanced by both delivery strains. Thus, the innate and adaptive immunogenicity of the strains was ensured. The environmental safety of these strains was ascertained through faecal dissemination assays. The nonpathogenicity of these strains to the host was confirmed by body weight monitoring, survival assays, and morphological and histological assessments of the vital organs. The in vitro assay in murine and human cell lines and in vivo safety assessments in mice suggest that these novel strains possess safety, invasiveness, and immunogenicity, making them ideal delivery strains. Overall, the results clearly showed that strain JOL2782 with sifA deletion had higher invasiveness, demonstrating superior vaccine deliverability, while JOL2837 with lpxE substitution for pagL and rfaL deletion had outstanding safety potential with drastically abridged endotoxicity.\",\n",

We hypothesized that cigarette smoking causes glycocalyx impairment and endothelial apoptosis in COPD, which could be repaired by the stimulation of fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10)/FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling.\\nWe used immunostaining (immunohistochemical [IHC] and immunofluorescence [IF]) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the levels of glycocalyx components and endothelial apoptosis in animal models and in patients with COPD. We used the murine emphysema model and in vitro studies to determine the protective and reparative role of FGF10/FGFR1.\\nExposure to cigarette smoke caused endothelial glycocalyx impairment and emphysematous changes in murine models and human specimens. Pretreatment of FGF10 attenuated the development of emphysema and the shedding of glycocalyx components induced by CSE in vivo. However, FGF10 did not attenuate the emphysema induced by endothelial-specific killing peptide CGSPGWVRC-GG-\\nOur results suggest that FGF10 may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy against COPD via endothelial repair and glycocalyx reconstitution.\",\n",

These effects were observed over a broad dose range with a long duration of action and were further enhanced under experimental oxidative stress conditions. In a unilateral broncho-occlusion minipig model, inhaled mosliciguat decreased pulmonary arterial pressure without ventilation/perfusion mismatch. With respect to airway resistance, mosliciguat showed additional beneficial bronchodilatory effects in an acetylcholine-induced rat model.\\nInhaled mosliciguat may overcome treatment limitations in patients with pulmonary hypertension by improving pulmonary circulation and airway resistance without systemic exposure or ventilation/perfusion mismatch.

Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains2 (LRIG2) is closely associated with the poor prognosis of a variety of tumors, but the role of LRIG2 in osteosarcoma and the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear.\\nThe aim of this study was to determine the function of LRIG2 in OS and the related molecular mechanism on cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration of OS.\\nThe mRNA and protein expression of LRIG2 in OS tissues and cells was detected by qRT-PCR, western blot (WB) assay and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), clone formation, transwell, TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) and WB assay were applied to determine the proliferation, migration and apoptosis abilities of OS cells and its molecular mechanisms. Spontaneous metastasis xenografts were established to confirm the role of LRIG2 in vivo.\\nLRIG2 exhibited high expression in OS tissues and OS cell lines and the expression of which was significantly correlated with Enneking stage of patients, knockdown LRIG2 expression significantly inhibited OS cell proliferation, migration and enhanced apoptosis. Silencing LRIG2 also suppressed the growth of subcutaneous transplanted tumor in nude mice. Further, the mechanism investigation revealed that the protein level of cell proapoptotic proteins (Bax, caspase9 and caspase3) all increased attributed to LRIG2 deficiency, whereas expression of anti-apoptotic protein BCL2 decreased. LRIG2 silencing led to the decrease phosphorylation of AKT signaling, a decrease expression of vimentin and N-cadherin. Additionally, silencing LRIG2 significantly decreased the rate of tumor growth and tumor size.\\nLRIG2 acts as an oncogene in osteosarcoma, and it might become a novel target in the treatment of human OS.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a highly aggressive malignant cancer in the biliary system with poor prognosis. XPO1 (chromosome region maintenance 1 or CRM1) mediates the nuclear export of several proteins, mainly tumor suppressors. Thus, XPO1 functions as a pro-oncogenic factor. KPT-330 (Selinexor) is a United States Food and Drug Administration approved selective inhibitor of XPO1 that demonstrates good therapeutic effects in hematologic cancers. However, the function of XPO1 and the effect of KPT-330 have not been reported in GBC.\\nWe analyzed the correlation between XPO1 expression levels by q-PCR and clinical features of GBC patients. Cell proliferation assays were used to analyze the in vitro antitumor effects of XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330. mRNA sequencing was used to explore the underlying mechanisms. Western blot was performed to explore the relationship between apoptosis and autophagy. The in vivo antitumor effect of KPT-330 was investigated in a nude mouse model of gallbladder cancer.\\nWe found that high expression of XPO1 was related to poor prognosis of GBC patients. We observed that XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330 inhibited the proliferation of GBC cells in vitro. Furthermore, XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330 induced apoptosis by reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential and triggering autophagy in NOZ and GBC-SD cells. Indeed, XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330 led to nuclear accumulation of p53 and activated the p53/mTOR pathway to regulate autophagy-dependent apoptosis. Importantly, KPT-330 suppressed tumor growth with no obvious toxic effects in vivo.\\nXPO1 may be a promising prognostic indicator for GBC, and KPT-330 appears to be a potential drug for treating GBC effectively and safely.\",\n",

Indeed, XPO1 inhibitor KPT-330 led to nuclear accumulation of p53 and activated the p53/mTOR pathway to regulate autophagy-dependent apoptosis.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a neuroprotective role by suppressing microglia and macrophage-mediated inflammation and modulating adaptive immune reactions. We previously documented that Treg immunomodulatory mechanisms are compromised in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Ex vivo expansion of Tregs restores and amplifies their immunosuppressive functions in vitro. A key question is whether adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded human Tregs can suppress neuroinflammation and amyloid pathology in a preclinical mouse model.\\nAn immunodeficient mouse model of AD was generated by backcrossing the 5xFAD onto Rag2 knockout mice (5xFAD-Rag2KO). Human Tregs were expanded ex vivo for 24\\u00a0days and administered to 5xFAD-Rag2KO. Changes in amyloid burden, microglia characteristics and reactive astrocytes were evaluated using ELISA and confocal microscopy. NanoString Mouse AD multiplex gene expression analysis was applied to explore the impact of ex vivo expanded Tregs on the neuroinflammation transcriptome.\\nElimination of mature B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in 5xFAD-Rag2KO mice was associated with upregulation of 95 inflammation genes and amplified number of reactive microglia within the dentate gyrus. Administration of ex vivo expanded Tregs reduced amyloid burden and reactive glial cells in the dentate gyrus and frontal cortex of 5xFAD-Rag2KO mice. Interrogation of inflammation gene expression documented down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1A&B, IL6), complement cascade (C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, C4a/b), toll-like receptors (Tlr3, Tlr4 and Tlr7) and microglial activations markers (CD14, Tyrobp,Trem2) following Treg administration.\\nEx vivo expanded Tregs with amplified immunomodulatory function, suppressed neuroinflammation and alleviated AD pathology in vivo. Our results provide preclinical evidences for Treg cell therapy as a potential treatment strategy in AD.\",\n",

The methoxy flavonoid compound 5-methoxyflavone (5-MF) is believed to have superior biological activity in the treatment of cancer. However, the effects and underlying mechanism of 5-MF on IV-mediated ALI are still unclear. Here, we showed that 5-MF significantly improved the survival of mice with lethal IV infection and ameliorated IV-mediated lung edema, lung histological changes, and inflammatory cell lung recruitment. We found that 5-MF has antiviral activity against influenza A virus (IAV), which was probably associated with increased expression of radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 (RSAD2) and suppression of endosomal acidification. Moreover, IV-infected A549 cells with 5-MF treatment markedly reduced proinflammatory mediator expression (IL-6, CXCL8, TNF-\\u03b1, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, GM-CSF, COX-2, and PGE\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Influenza infection is difficult to prevent, control, and treat because of rapid viral mutation, fast disease progression, and high mortality. Vaccination is the main means by which to prevent and control influenza, but effectiveness is limited in that poor cellular uptake and weak immunogenicity of vaccines provides less than optimal host protection. Liposomal influenza vaccines are a promising strategy to overcome these limitations and the use of liposomal immune modulators and intranasal administration of liposomal influenza vaccines may be a means by which to improve influenza protection. The cationic lipids, i.e., dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA), 1,2-dioctadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), and D-\\u03b1-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 (TPGS) can form blank liposomes, which can incorporate influenza antigens to produce an influenza vaccine (DDA-DSPC-TPGS). Herein, this vaccine was shown to induce dendritic cell maturation, increase host cellular uptake of the vaccine, and enhance immune responses both in vitro and in vivo. The addition of TPGS, as an amphiphilic immune adjuvant, significantly reduced the toxicity of the DDA liposomal influenza vaccine. Further, the polyethylene glycol component and tocopherol structure of TPGS enhanced the cellular uptake of the vaccine by means of stealth properties and the capacity to inhibit cellular efflux. After nasal mucosal immunization, enhanced cellular uptake rates and abundant immune cells in the nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue promoted the production of immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin G1, and interferon-\\u03b3, which in turn mediated a more robust immune response against influenza virus. In summary, the DDA-DSPC-TPGS influenza vaccine is a safe and effective means by which to activate the immune system. The results herein provide an effective strategy by which to overcome current difficulties associated with the prevention and treatment of influenza.\",\n",

In this chapter, we describe the methods of depleting regulatory T cells (Tregs) systemically or selectively in the skin. Since it has been difficult to conclude the importance of tissue-residing Tregs with\\u00a0systemic Treg ablation, we sought to selectively deplete cutaneous Tregs to investigate their function in the skin without the depletion of Tregs in non-target organs. Here, we describe protocols for the depletion of Tregs by the DT system, and subsequent analysis of Tregs in the skin and skin-draining lymph node (dLN) by flow cytometry. This procedure of selective depletion of cutaneous Tregs can be applicable to other tissues and cells, to allow investigation of the role of tissue-resident cells in mice.\",\n",

An isoflavone-rich (ISO) diet was previously shown to reduce the severity of MS in the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Translation of this concept to clinical trial where dietary isoflavones may be recommended for MS patients will require preliminary evidence that providing the isoflavone-rich diet to people with MS (PwMS) who lack phytoestrogen-metabolizing bacteria has beneficial effects. We have previously shown that the gut microbiota of PwMS resembles the gut microbiota of mice raised under a phytoestrogen-free (phyto-free) diet in that it lacks phytoestrogen-metabolizing bacteria. To investigate the effects of phytoestrogens on the microbiota inflammatory response and EAE disease severity we switched the diet of mice raised under a phyto-free (PF) diet to an isoflavone-rich diet. Microbiota analysis showed that the change in diet from one that is ISO to one that is PF reduces beneficial bacteria such as \",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Emerging evidence provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), and rare anti-PF therapeutic method has promising effect in its treatment. Rho-associated coiled-coil kinases (ROCK) inhibition significantly ameliorates bleomycin-induced PF and decreases macrophage infiltration, but the mechanism remains unclear. We established bleomycin and radiation-induced PF to identify the activity of WXWH0265, a newly designed unselective ROCK inhibitor in regulating macrophages.\\nBleomycin-induced PF was induced by intratracheal instillation and radiation-induced PF was induced by bilateral thoracic irradiation. Histopathological techniques (haematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome and immunohistochemistry) and hydroxyproline were used to evaluate PF severity. Western blot, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were used to verify their therapeutic effect. Clodronate liposomes were applied to deplete macrophages and to identify the therapeutic effect of WXWH0265.\\nTherapeutic administration of ROCK inhibitor ameliorates bleomycin-induced PF by inhibiting M2 macrophages polarisation. ROCK inhibitor showed no significant anti-fibrotic effect in macrophages-depleted mice. Treatment with WXWH0265 demonstrated superior protection effect in bleomycin-induced PF compared with positive drugs. In radiation-induced PF, ROCK inhibitor effectively ameliorated PF. Fibroblasts co-cultured with supernatant from various M2 macrophages phenotypes revealed that M2 macrophages stimulated by interleukin-4 promoted extracellular matrix production. Polarisation of M2 macrophages was inhibited by ROCK inhibitor treatment in vitro. The p-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in lung tissue and BMDMs was significantly decreased in PF in vivo and vitro after treated with ROCK inhibitors.\\nInhibiting ROCK could significantly attenuate bleomycin- and radiation-induced PF by regulating the macrophages polarisation via phosphorylation of STAT3. WXWH0265 is a kind of efficient unselective ROCK inhibitor in ameliorating PF. Furthermore, the results provide empirical evidence that ROCK inhibitor, WXWH0265 is a potential drug to prevent the development of PF.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Our previous research demonstrated P2X purinergic receptors as important extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) sensing receptors promoting the trafficking of hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs). Accordingly, mice deficient in expression of P2X4 and P2X7 receptors turned out to mobilize poorly HSPCs. Similarly, defective expression of these receptors on transplanted HSPCs or in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment of graft recipient mice led to defective homing, engraftment, and delayed hematopoietic reconstitution. This correlated with decreased activation of intracellular pattern recognition receptor Nlrp3 inflammasome. The P2X receptor family consists of seven purinergic receptors (P2X1-7) and we noticed that in addition to P2X4 and P2X7, HSPCs also highly express rapidly signaling the P2X1 receptor. Therefore, we asked if P2X1 receptor is also involved in HSPCs trafficking.\\nWe employed in vitro and in vivo murine models to study the role of P2X1 receptor blocked on HSPCs or bone marrow microenvironment cells by specific small molecular inhibitor NF499. First, we performed in vitro cell migration assays of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) isolated from normal mice that were exposed to NF499 and compared them to unexposed control cells. Next, in experiments in vivo we mobilized mice exposed to NF499 with G-CSF or AMD3100 and compared mobilization to control unexposed animals. Flow cytometry was employed to identify cell populations and clonogenic assays to enumerate the number of mobilized clonogenic progenitors. Similarly, in homing and engraftment experiments BMMNCs or recipient mice were exposed to NF499 and we evaluated homing and engraftment of transplanted cells by enumerating the number of cells labeled with fluorochromes in recipient mice BM and by evaluating the number of clonogenic progenitors in BM and spleen 24 hours and 12 days after transplantation. We also evaluated the potential involvement of Nlrp3 inflammasome in P2X1 receptor-mediated HSPCs trafficking.\\nWe report that the functional P2X1 receptor is highly expressed on murine and human HSPCs. We could demonstrate that the P2X1 receptor promotes the trafficking of murine cells in Nlrp3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Mice after exposure to P2X1 receptor inhibitor poorly mobilized HSPCs from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood. Mice transplanted with BMNNCs exposed to NF499 or recipient mice pretreated with this inhibitor demonstrated defective homing and engraftment as compared to control animals transplanted with cells not exposed to P2X1 inhibitor. Similar effects were noticed for control recipient mice that were not exposed to NF499.\\nThis study demonstrates for the first time the novel role of the P2X1 receptor in HSPCs trafficking in the mouse. Furthermore, it supports an important role of purinergic signaling engaging its downstream target Nlrp3 inflammasome in the mobilization, homing and engraftment of HSPCs.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Acute spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating result of neurological trauma with subsequent microenvironment dyshomeostasis that induces neurotoxic phenotype acquisition by astrocytes, exacerbating neurological function impairment. Exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) have demonstrated essential therapeutic effects after central nervous system trauma. However, whether hUCMSC-derived exosomes exert therapeutic effects on neurotoxic astrocytes to facilitate SCI function recovery remains unclear. Additionally, the limited efficiency of single exosomes may restrict the optimization of exosomal biological functions.\\nWe first determined that exosomes reduce the deleterious effects of neurotoxic astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. Then, we identified critical functional microRNAs (miRNAs). miR-146a-5p was overexpressed in exosomes, and then, miR-146a-5p-modified exosomes were used to investigate the ability of exosomes to reduce neurotoxic astrocyte effects, preserve neurons and promote neurological function recovery in rats with SCI.\\nCell counting kit-8 and neurite length analyses revealed that exosomes partially reduced the negative effects of neurotoxic astrocytes on PC12 cell viability and neurites in vitro. The exosomes also attenuated inflammatory responses, reduced the number of neurotoxic astrocytes and preserved neural tissue in rats with SCI. Immunofluorescence assays suggested that the number of neurotoxic astrocytes was rapidly increased by injury, reaching a peak 5\\u00a0days post-injury (dpi) and returning to the normal level 14dpi. Exosomal miR-146a-5p was identified as the critical functional miRNA. Overexpression of miR-146a-5p in exosomes strengthened the biological function of the exosomes. Therefore, the modified exosomes exerted more powerful therapeutic effects than the unmodified exosomes, reducing the deleterious effects of neurotoxic astrocytes both in vitro and in vivo and promoting locomotor function of the hindlimbs in the rats with SCI. Through a series of gain- and loss-of-function experiments, Traf6 and Irak1 were identified as targets of exosomal miR-146a-5p. Ultimately, we found that miR-146a-5p-modified exosomes exerted their function by targeting Traf6/Irak1/NF\\u03baB pathway in neurotoxic astrocytes.\\nIn summary, miR-146a-5p-modified exosomes exerted a more powerful effect than unmodified exosomes to promote neurological function recovery in rats with SCI by targeting neurotoxic astrocytes. Therefore, miR-146a-5p-modified exosomes are promising therapeutics for SCI.\",\n",

      "    \"results\": \"Cell counting kit-8 and neurite length analyses revealed that exosomes partially reduced the negative effects of neurotoxic astrocytes on PC12 cell viability and neurites in vitro. The exosomes also attenuated inflammatory responses, reduced the number of neurotoxic astrocytes and preserved neural tissue in rats with SCI. Immunofluorescence assays suggested that the number of neurotoxic astrocytes was rapidly increased by injury, reaching a peak 5\\u00a0days post-injury (dpi) and returning to the normal level 14dpi. Exosomal miR-146a-5p was identified as the critical functional miRNA. Overexpression of miR-146a-5p in exosomes strengthened the biological function of the exosomes. Therefore, the modified exosomes exerted more powerful therapeutic effects than the unmodified exosomes, reducing the deleterious effects of neurotoxic astrocytes both in vitro and in vivo and promoting locomotor function of the hindlimbs in the rats with SCI. Through a series of gain- and loss-of-function experiments, Traf6 and Irak1 were identified as targets of exosomal miR-146a-5p. Ultimately, we found that miR-146a-5p-modified exosomes exerted their function by targeting Traf6/Irak1/NF\\u03baB pathway in neurotoxic astrocytes.\",\n",

Here an interaction between ferroptosis of cancer cells and natural killer (NK) cells was investigated with a clinical grade iron oxide nanoparticle (ferumoxytol) for potential synergistic anti-cancer effect of ferroptosis and NK cell therapy in prostate cancer. When ferumoxytol mediated ferroptosis of cancer cells was combined with NK cells, the NK cells' cytotoxic function was increased. Observed ferroptosis mediated NK cell activation was also confirmed with IFN-\\u03b3 secretion and lytic degranulation. Upregulation of ULBPs, which is one of the ligands for NK cell activating receptor NKG2D, was observed in the co-treatment of ferumoxytol mediated ferroptosis and NK cells. Additionally, HMGB1 and PD-L1 expression of cancer cells were observed in the treatment of ferroptosis\\u2009+\\u2009NK cells. Finally, in vivo therapeutic efficacy of ferumoxytol mediated ferroptosis and NK cell therapy was observed with significant tumor volume regression in a prostate cancer mice model. These results suggest that the NK cells' function can be enhanced with ferumoxytol mediated ferroptosis.\",\n",

In this study, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that valeric acid (VA) was a HDAC inhibitor, and anti-cancer efficacy of VA in prostate cancer cells was also observed using either 2D or 3D culture systems. VA was cytotoxic for prostate cancer cells but low toxic to normal cells. VA significantly inhibited E2F1/E2F3 expression but increased CASP3 activity. In vivo mouse models further showed its anti-cancer activity and potential property of chemosensitizer with promoting apoptosis. The findings suggest that VA acts as a HDAC3 inhibitor with anti-cancer effect on prostate cancer by regulating E2F1/E2F3/CASP3 axis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"CD36 is emerging as a potential strategy for cancer treatment because of its function of regulating fatty acid intake. The purpose of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanism of CD36 in the progression of HCC. TCGA database was used to analyze the relationship of CD36 with HCC. The expression of CD36 in HCC clinical samples and cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. Huh7 cells and HCCLM3 cells were transfected and treated into different group. CCK-8 and clone formation assay were used to detect the cell proliferation ability. Wound healing and transwell experiment were used to detect the metastatic ability. HCC xenografts were constructed in nude mice by subcutaneous injection of stably transfected Huh7 cells. The expression of CD36 in HCC was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The contents of phospholipids and triglycerides in HCC cells were detected by ELISA. And the content of neutral lipids in HCC cells was detected by staining with BODIPY 493/503 and DAPI dye. Then transcriptional sequencing was used to determine the downstream mechanism of CD36 in HCC, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed. CD36 was upregulated in HCC. Knockdown of CD36 could suppress the proliferation and metastasis of HCC in vitro and in vivo by regulating FAs intake in HCC. In addition, the expression of AKR1C2 was suppressed by sh-CD36, and which was also involved in the regulation of FAs intake. The molecular mechanism by which CD36 accelerated the progression of HCC was to promote the expression of AKR1C2 and thus enhance fatty acids (FAs) intake.\",\n",

Proteins filtered by glomeruli are endocytosed and degraded in the proximal tubule and defects in this process result in tubular proteinuria, an important clinical biomarker. However, the spatiotemporal organization of renal protein metabolism in vivo was previously unclear. Here, using functional probes and intravital microscopy, we track the fate of filtered proteins in real time in living mice, and map specialized processing to tubular structures with singular value decomposition analysis and three-dimensional electron microscopy. We reveal that degradation of proteins requires sequential, coordinated activity of distinct tubular sub-segments, each adapted to specific tasks. Moreover, we leverage this approach to pinpoint the nature of endo-lysosomal disorders in disease models, and show that compensatory uptake in later regions of the proximal tubule limits urinary protein loss. This means that measurement of proteinuria likely underestimates severity of endocytotic defects in patients.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) is highly overexpressed in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and correlates with tumor stage and metastatic burden. Although several lines of evidence suggest that BMP2 promotes cell migration and invasiveness in vitro, the in vivo role of BMP2 in the metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma cells remains less well understood. Here, we revealed that BMP2 is highly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma patients with lymph node metastasis compared with patients without lymph node metastasis. Using an in vivo orthotopic mouse model, we clearly demonstrated that BMP2 promotes lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. The depletion of BMP2 or its receptor BMPR2 significantly reduced cell migration and invasiveness. We further identified that BMP2/BMPR2-mediated cell migration involves the activation of the SMAD1/5/8 signaling pathway, independent of the KRAS signaling pathway. Significantly, the depletion of SMAD1/5/8 or the inhibition of SMAD1/5/8 by LDN193189 inhibitor significantly reduced cell migration. These findings show that BMP2 promotes NSCLC metastasis, indicating that targeting the BMP2 signaling pathway may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for treating patients with metastatic NSCLC.\",\n",

To ensure homeostasis, this process needs to be reversible however, this step is not well understood. We show that myosin phosphatase target subunit 1- protein phosphatase 1\\u03b2 (MYPT1-PP1\\u03b2) phosphatase activity is inhibited via PKA-dependent phosphorylation, which increases phosphorylated JMJD1A and beige adipogenesis. Mechanistically, MYPT1-PP1\\u03b2 depletion results in JMJD1A-mediated H3K9 demethylation and activation of the Ucp1 enhancer/promoter regions. Interestingly, MYPT1-PP1\\u03b2 also dephosphorylates myosin light chain which regulates actomyosin tension-mediated activation of YAP/TAZ which directly stimulates Ucp1 gene expression. Pre-adipocyte specific Mypt1 deficiency increases cold tolerance with higher Ucp1 levels in subcutaneous white adipose tissues compared to control mice, confirming this regulatory mechanism in vivo. Thus, we have uncovered regulatory cross-talk involved in beige adipogenesis that coordinates epigenetic regulation with direct activation of the mechano-sensitive YAP/TAZ transcriptional co-activators.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"F-actin dynamics is crucial for many fundamental properties of cancer cells, from cell-substrate adhesion to migration, invasion and metastasis. However, the regulatory mechanisms of actin dynamics are still incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate the function of a protein named TM9SF4 in regulating actin dynamics and controlling cancer cell motility and metastasis. We show that an N-terminal fragment (NTF) cleaved from TM9SF4 can directly bind to F-actin to induce actin oxidation at Cys374, consequently enhancing cofilin-mediated F-actin disassembly. Knockdown of TM9SF4 reduces cell migration and invasion in ovarian cancer cells A2780, SKOV3 and several high grade serous ovarian cancer lines (HGSOCs). In vivo, knockdown of TM9SF4 completely abolishes the tumor growth and metastasis in athymic nude mice. These data provide mechanistic insights into TM9SF4-mediated regulation of actin dynamics in ovarian cancer cells.\",\n",

However, cytoplasmic actin defies this rule because its synthesis involves noncanonical excision of the acetylated methionine by an unidentified enzyme after translation. Here, we identified C19orf54, named ACTMAP (actin maturation protease), as this enzyme. Its ablation resulted in viable mice in which the cytoskeleton was composed of immature actin molecules across all tissues. However, in skeletal muscle, the lengths of sarcomeric actin filaments were shorter, muscle function was decreased, and centralized nuclei, a common hallmark of myopathies, progressively accumulated. Thus, ACTMAP encodes the missing factor required for the synthesis of mature actin and regulates specific actin-dependent traits in vivo.\",\n",

The effects of FGL-1 knockdown on the proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of laryngeal cancer cells were evaluated by the CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, Transwell migration, and western blot assays. We detected changes in tumorigenesis and drug response \\nFGL-1 was highly expressed in the plasma and tumor tissues of laryngeal cancer patients. FGL-1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation of TU-686 cells and inhibited the migration and invasion of laryngeal cancer by blocking epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, silencing FGL-1 inhibited tumorigenicity \\nWe confirmed the high expression of FGL-1 in laryngeal cancer and identified FGL-1 as a potential marker for immunotherapy in laryngeal cancer.\",\n",

Therapeutic antibodies against tumour antigens have become the predominant class of new drugs in cancer therapy because of their fewer adverse effects and high specificity.\\nThis study was designed to investigate the therapeutic and anti-metastatic potential of the two newly obtained anti-nNav1.5 antibodies, polyclonal anti-nNav1.5 (pAb-nNav1.5) and monoclonal anti-nNav1.5 (mAb-nNav1.5), on breast cancer invasion and metastasis.\\nMDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells were used as in vitro models to study the effect of pAb-nNav1.5 (59.2 \\u00b5g/ml) and mAb-nNav1.5 (10 \\u00b5g/ml) (24 hours treatment) on cell invasion. 4T1-induced mammary tumours in BALB/c female mice were used as an in vivo model to study the effect of a single dose of intravenous pAb-nNav1.5 (1 mg/ml) and mAb-nNav1.5 (1 mg/ml) on the occurrence of metastasis. Real-time PCR and immunofluorescence staining were conducted to assess the effect of antibody treatment on nNav1.5 mRNA and protein expression, respectively. The animals' body weight, organs, lesions, and tumour mass were also measured and compared.\\npAb-nNav1.5 and mAb-nNav1.5 treatments effectively suppressed the invasion of MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells in the 3D spheroid invasion assay. Both antibodies significantly reduced nNav1.5 gene and protein expression in these cell lines. Treatment with pAb-nNav1.5 and mAb-nNav1.5 successfully reduced mammary tumour tissue size and mass and prevented lesions in vital organs of the mammary tumour animal model whilst maintaining the animal's healthy weight. mRNA expression of nNav1.5 in mammary tumour tissues was only reduced by mAb-nNav1.5.\\nOverall, this work verifies the uniqueness of targeting nNav1.5 in breast cancer invasion and metastasis prevention, but more importantly, humanised versions of mAb-nNav1.5 may be valuable passive immunotherapeutic agents to target nNav1.5 in breast cancer.\",\n",

We have previously demonstrated PAR-1 signalling primes innate myeloid cells to be exquisitely sensitive to interferon-gamma (IFN\\u03b3). In this work we explored how TF mediated PAR-2 signalling modulated responsiveness to IFN\\u03b3 and investigated the interplay between PAR-1/-2 signalling on macrophages.\\nWe characterised how TF through PAR-2 influenced IFN\\u03b3 sensitivity \\nTF delivered a basal signal through PAR-2 that upregulated SOCS3 expression and blunted M1 polarisation after IFN\\u03b3 stimulation, opposing the priming achieved by signalling through PAR-1. PAR-1 and -2 agonists or antagonists could be used in combination to modify this basal signal \\nTF-mediated signalling through PARs-1 and -2 act in a homeostatic way to determine how myeloid cells respond to IFN\\u03b3. 3-MP, an agent that simultaneously inhibits PAR-1 whilst delivering a PAR-2 signal, can almost completely abolish immune responses dependent on M1 polarisation, particularly if potency is enhanced by targeting to cell membranes; this has potential therapeutic potential in multiple diseases.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Tumor immunotherapy is a key therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of several malignancies. However, in metastatic lung cancer, classical immunotherapy regimes are ineffective due to regulatory T cell (Treg)-related immunosuppression and tumor relapse.\\nTo address this issue, we designed specific biocompatible Treg-targeted nanocarriers (NCs) as a model of immune-based nanotherapy, in order to target Treg-related immunosuppression in the lung tumor microenvironment. This is achieved through the combination of Dasatinib and Epacadostat integrated into biodegradable nanosomes which can inhibit and reverse Treg-supporting immunosuppression. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analysis, PET/CT scan, PTT/PA imaging and the Balb/c tumor model were used to explore the anti-tumor effect of Treg-targeted NCs both in vitro and in vivo.\\nFindings reveal that NC treatment triggered substantial tumor cell apoptosis and drastically decreased tumor volume followed by downregulation of Ki-67 antigen expression, respectively. Drug circulation time was also increased as shown by biodistribution analysis accompanied by greater accumulation in lung and peripheral tissues. Intratumoral Th1 cytokines' expression was also increased, especially TNF-A, IL-12 by 42%, and IL-6 by 18% compared to PBS treatment. In addition, the presence of mature CD80\\nOverall, our findings present a novel nano-enabled platform for the inhibition of Treg-dependent immunosuppression in NSCLC and provide a novel nanotherapeutic strategy for the treatment of metastatic neoplasia.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Peptide proteolysis-targeting chimeras (p-PROTACs) with advantages of high specificity and low toxicity have emerged as a powerful technology of targeted protein degradation for biomedical applications. FOXM1, a proliferation-associated transcription factor, is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors as a key driver of tumorigenesis and cancer progression, and is a potential anticancer therapeutic target. However, FOXM1-targeting p-PROTACs has not been researched.\\nHere, we first analyzed the expression of FOXM1, GLUT1 and PD-L1 in liver cancer through database and clinical samples of patients. FOXM1-targeting peptides, selected by screening phage display library, are verified its targeting effect by immunofluorescence and CCK-8 test. The novel p-PROTAC degrader of FOXM1 is chemically synthesis, named FOXM1-PROTAC, by linking a FOXM1-binding antagonistic peptide, with the E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment ligand Pomalidomide and with the cell membrane penetrating peptide TAT. Its degradation effect on FOXM1 was detected by Western blotting, qPCR, and we verified its effect on the behavior of cancer cells by flow cytometry, scratch assay, and Transwell in vitro. The tumor xenografted mice model was used for evaluating FOXM1-PROTAC therapeutic response in vivo. Finally, we detected the expression of GLUT1 and PD-L1 after FOXM1-PROTAC degraded FOXM1 by using Western Blotting and hippocampal detectors and dual immunofluorescence.\\nWe found that the novel FOXM1-PROTAC efficiently entered cells and induced degradation of FOXM1 protein, which strongly inhibits viability as well as migration and invasion in various cancer cell lines, and suppressed tumor growth in HepG2 and MDA-MB-231 cells xenograft mouse models, without detected toxicity in normal tissues. Meanwhile, FOXM1-PROTAC decreased the cancer cells glucose metabolism via downregulating the protein expression levels of glucose transporter GLUT1 and the immune checkpoint PD-L1, which suggests involvement of FOXM1 in cancer cell metabolism and immune regulation.\\nOur results indicate that biologically targeted degradation of FOXM1 is an attractive therapeutic strategy, and antagonist peptide-containing FOXM1-PROTACs as both degrader and inhibitor of FOXM1 could be developed as a safe and promising drug for FOXM1-overexpressed cancer therapy.\",\n",

Meanwhile, FOXM1-PROTAC decreased the cancer cells glucose metabolism via downregulating the protein expression levels of glucose transporter GLUT1 and the immune checkpoint PD-L1, which suggests involvement of FOXM1 in cancer cell metabolism and immune regulation.\",\n",

Erbin has been reported to be associated with various inflammatory diseases. However, the role of Erbin in SAE and the relationship between Erbin and microglia pyroptosis are unknown. In this study, we investigated the promising role and underlying molecular mechanism of Erbin in the regulation of microglia pyroptosis.\\nWT and Erbin knockout mice underwent cecum ligation perforation (CLP) to induce SAE. Primary mouse microglia and BV2 cells were treated with LPS/nigericin in vitro. Behavioral tests were performed to evaluate cognitive function. Nissl staining and transmission electron microscopy were used to assess histological and structural lesions. ELISA and qPCR were carried out to detect neuroinflammation. Western blot and immunofluorescence were used to analyze protein expression. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy were utilized to observe the Ca\\nErbin deletion resulted in more pronounced neuronal damage and cognitive impairment in mice that underwent CLP. Erbin knockout promoted microglial pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokines secretion in vivo and in vitro, which was mediated by activation of the IRE1\\u03b1/Xbp1s. Treatment with the selective inhibitor STF083010 significantly inhibited IRE1\\u03b1/Xbp1s pathway activity, decreased intracytoplasmic Ca\\nIn SAE, Erbin inhibits IRE1/Xbp1s pathway activity and reduces the ER Ca\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This study investigates the development of atazanavir-concentrate loaded soft gelatin capsule for achieving enhanced atazanavir (ATV) concentration in plasma, brain, spleen, and lymphatics beneficial in the significant reduction of viral load in HIV infection. For this purpose, ATV-concentrate in the presence and absence of Soluplus with corn oil, oleic acid, tween 80, and propylene glycol was developed. The developed ATV-concentrate was found to have enhanced dispersibility with no signs of precipitation after dilution with simulated G.I fluid as evident from particle size (16.49\\u00b10.32 nm) and PDI (0.217\\u00b10.02) analysis. The rheological and molecular docking studies explainedthe reduction of viscosity of SuATV-C due to the intermolecular H-bond between ATV and Soluplus that helps to retard crystallization. The shell of the soft gelatin capsule retains its integrity when subjected to a folding endurance test on a texture analyzer depicting that the concentrate did not affect the integrity of the soft gelatin capsule shell. An ex vivo and in vivo pharmacokinetic study in rats revealed that the SuATV-C soft gelatin capsule (SuATV-C SGC) indicated 2.9 fold improvement in rate and extent of permeation and absorption than that of ATV-suspension. The tissue distribution study also exhibited higher drug concentration in the brain (2.5 fold), lymph nodes (2.7 fold), and spleen (1.2 fold) administered with SuATV-C SGC, revealing the overwhelming influence of Soluplus and corn oil. In a nutshell, these studies demonstrated that SuATV-C SGC seems to have the potential to deliver an anti-retroviral drug to the viral sanctuaries for the better management of HIV.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Given the complex nature of ulcerative colitis, combination therapy targeting multiple pathogenic genes and pathways of ulcerative colitis may be required. Unfortunately, current therapeutic strategies are usually based on independent chemical compounds or monoclonal antibodies, and the full potential of combination therapy has not yet been realized for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Here, we develop a synthetic biology strategy that integrates the naturally existing circulating system of small extracellular vesicles with artificial genetic circuits to reprogram the liver of male mice to self-assemble multiple siRNAs into secretory small extracellular vesicles and facilitate in vivo delivery siRNAs through circulating small extracellular vesicles for the combination therapy of mouse models of ulcerative colitis. Particularly, repeated injection of the multi-targeted genetic circuit designed for simultaneous inhibition of TNF-\\u03b1, B7-1 and integrin \\u03b14 rapidly relieves intestinal inflammation and exerts a synergistic therapeutic effect against ulcerative colitis through suppressing the pro-inflammatory cascade in colonic macrophages, inhibiting the costimulatory signal to T cells and blocking T cell homing to sites of inflammation. More importantly, we design an AAV-driven genetic circuit to induce substantial and lasting inhibition of TNF-\\u03b1, B7-1 and integrin \\u03b14 through only a single injection. Overall, this study establishes a feasible combination therapeutic strategy for ulcerative colitis, which may offer an alternative to conventional biological therapies requiring two or more independent compounds or antibodies.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Upregulation of EWSR1-FLI1 expression has been associated with invasiveness, induced cell survival, metastatic dissemination, and acquisition of self-renewal traits in Ewing sarcoma (ES). Although existing evidence implies that TrkC expression is linked to the pathogenesis of other cancer types, its role and the mechanism behind its correlation with EWSR1-FLI1 in the pathogenesis of ES remain unclear. In this study, we uncovered a novel physiological role of TrkC as a key regulator of EWSR1-FLI1 involved in the survival and metastatic dissemination of ES. TrkC was observed to be frequently overexpressed in human metastatic ES cells in vitro and in vivo, facilitating enhanced survival, tumorigenicity, and metastasis of ES cells. TrkC-mediated metastasis of ES cells was induced by the inhibition of the proteasomal degradation of EWSR1-FLI1 via the TrkC/EWSR1-FLI1 complex, which subsequently enabled the induction of the target proteins, EGR2 and NKX2.2. Moreover, TrkC significantly inhibited tumor suppressor activity of TGF-\\u03b2 through reduction of the mRNA expression of one of its receptors, TGFBR2 via TrkC-induced stabilization of EWSR1-FLI1. Furthermore, loss of TrkC expression inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in experimental mouse models. This study is the first to report the involvement and functional role of TrkC in the pathogenesis of ES, suggesting important implications for understanding the alterations of TrkC in Ewing tumors.\",\n",

To understand how lesion environments influence transplanted NPC fate in vivo, we derived NPC expressing a ribosomal protein-hemagglutinin tag (RiboTag) for transcriptional profiling of transplanted NPC. Here, we show that NPC grafted into uninjured mouse CNS generate cells that are transcriptionally similar to healthy astrocytes and oligodendrocyte lineages. In striking contrast, NPC transplanted into subacute CNS lesions after stroke or spinal cord injury in mice generate cells that share transcriptional, morphological and functional features with newly proliferated host astroglia that restrict inflammation and fibrosis and isolate lesions from adjacent viable neural tissue. Our findings reveal overlapping differentiation potentials of grafted NPC and proliferating host astrocytes; and show that in the absence of other interventions, non-cell autonomous cues in subacute CNS lesions direct the differentiation of grafted NPC towards a naturally occurring wound repair astroglial phenotype.\",\n",

However, basic physiology of PFC astrocytes, including which neuromodulatory signals they respond to and how they contribute to PFC function, is unclear. Here, we characterize divergent signaling signatures in mouse astrocytes of the PFC and primary sensory cortex, which show differential responsiveness to locomotion.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Mast cells (MCs) are granulated cells implicated in inflammatory disorders because of their capacity to degranulate, releasing prestored proinflammatory mediators. As MCs have the unique capacity to reform granules following degranulation in\\u00a0vitro, their potential to regranulate in\\u00a0vivo is linked to their pathogenesis. It is not known what factors regulate regranulation, let\\u00a0alone if regranulation occurs in\\u00a0vivo. We report that mice can undergo multiple bouts of MC regranulation following successive anaphylactic reactions. mTORC1, a nutrient sensor that activates protein and lipid synthesis, is necessary for regranulation. mTORC1 activity is regulated by a glucose-6-phosphate transporter, Slc37a2, which increases intracellular glucose-6-phosphate and ATP during regranulation, two upstream signals of mTOR. Additionally, Slc37a2 concentrates extracellular metabolites within endosomes, which are trafficked into nascent granules. Thus, the metabolic switch associated with MC regranulation is mediated by the interactions of a cellular metabolic sensor and a transporter of extracellular metabolites into MC granules.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The use of micromotors for active drug delivery via oral administration has recently gained considerable interest. However, efficient motor-assisted delivery into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract remains challenging, owing to the short propulsion lifetime of currently used micromotor platforms. Here, we report on an efficient algae-based motor platform, which takes advantage of the fast and long-lasting swimming behavior of natural microalgae in intestinal fluid to prolong local retention within the GI tract. Fluorescent dye or cell membrane-coated nanoparticle functionalized algae motors were further embedded inside a pH-sensitive capsule to enhance delivery to the small intestines. In vitro, the algae motors displayed a constant motion behavior in simulated intestinal fluid after 12 hours of continuous operation. When orally administered in vivo into mice, the algae motors substantially improved GI distribution of the dye payload compared with traditional magnesium-based micromotors, which are limited by short propulsion lifetimes, and they also enhanced retention of a model chemotherapeutic payload in the GI tract compared with a passive nanoparticle formulation. Overall, combining the efficient motion and extended lifetime of natural algae-based motors with the protective capabilities of oral capsules results in a promising micromotor platform capable of achieving greatly improved cargo delivery in GI tissue for practical biomedical applications.\",\n",

Cre delivery activates the expression of a reporter gene in both neurons and astrocytes of the cortex without tissue damage and with a transduction efficiency that parallels or exceeds that of a commonly used adeno-associated virus. Our data indicate that the delivery peptides mediate efficient endosomal leakage and cytosolic escape in cells that have endocytosed Cre. The peptides, therefore, act in trans and do not require conjugation to the payload, greatly simplifying sample preparation. Moreover, the delivery peptides are exclusively composed of natural amino acids and are consequently readily degradable and processed by cells. We envision that this approach will be beneficial to applications that require the transient introduction of proteins into cells in vivo.\",\n",

Therefore, this research aimed to explore how METTL3 affects the inflammatory process of fungal keratitis (FK) in mice.\\nWe established in vitro and in vivo models by inoculating mice and primary corneal stromal cells with F. solani. METTL3 expression was confirmed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. After that, siRNAMETTL3 and AAV-sh-METTL3 were transfected into cells and mice to explore the role of METTL3 in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and inflammation. PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, and p-AKT expression was analyzed by western blotting. Viability of corneal stromal cells was measured using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). Additionally, we detected interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1\\u03b2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\\u03b1) levels in corneal tissues and analyzed the role of METTL3 in inflammation in FK using slit-lamp biomicroscopy and hematoxylin and eosin staining.\\nHere, our results show that METTL3 increased in mouse FK, and the expression of p-PI3K and p-AKT decreased when METTL3 was downregulated. We also found that knockdown of METTL3 expression attenuated the inflammatory response and decreased TNF-\\u03b1, IL-1\\u03b2, and IL-6 expression in corneal-infected mice. Furthermore, inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway attenuated the inflammatory response of FK, decreased the expression of the above inflammatory factors, and enhanced the viability of corneal stromal cells.\\nBased on the study results, METTL3 downregulation attenuates Fusarium-induced corneal inflammation via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Post-operative ileus (POI) is a type of bowel dismotility causing accumulation of gas and fluid. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been frequently used for medical applications such as pain treatment and nervous stimulation. In this experimental animal model of POI, our aim is to investigate the effects of TENS on POI, and to demonstrate histopathological changes in rat intestine after TENS application.\\nThe present study is an experimental animal model of POI. Sixteen Wistar-Albino male rats in two groups were used and laparotomy was performed. After colorectum and small intestine were manipulated, activated charcoal and Nile red were ad-ministered by oral gavage. Electrodes were placed to the abdomen skin of the rats and TENS method was used. Rats in two groups were sacrificed on 24 h. The esophagus, stomach, and all intestines of the rats were resected and a direct X-ray and computerized tomography scan, and 'J' images were taken, and the progression of active coals was measured radiologically. Histopathological and microscopic evaluation was performed.\\nThe median of activated charcoal measure was 429 mm (178-594) in TENS group, 203 mm (149-313) in the control group, respectively, and these were statistically significant (p=0.004963). There was a significant difference between the two groups in terms of histopathological necrosis (p=0.041). In addition, the amount of Nil Red (550 nm) in the GI track is increased after 8 h of gavage with sequential applications of TENS.\\nThis study demonstrated the protective and therapeutic efficacy of TENS in POI in a rat model by radiologically and histopathologically. In clinical practice, TENS may be examined on POI. Further studies are warranted to validate and generalize our findings, and to assess the impact of TENS for post-operative pain also.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is induced by an interrupted blood flow and succeeding blood restoration, which is common in the operation of liver transplantation. Serious IR injury is a major reason leading to transplant failure. Hepatic IR is featured by excessive inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Sinomenine (SIN) is derived from the herb Sinomeniumacutum and shows properties of anti-inflammation and antiapoptosis in multiple IR-induced organ injuries. However, the effect of SIN in hepatic IR has not been investigated.\\nThis study aims to investigate impacts of SIN on hepatic IR and the involved signaling pathway. An in vivo rat model of syngeneic orthotopic liver transplantation was constructed to induce the hepatic IR injury.\\nResults showed that SIN pretreatment provided a significant prevention against IR-induced hepatic injury as manifested by the downregulated activities of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase, the alleviatedoxidative stress as shown by increased activities of serum superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, and decreased serum level of malondialdehyde, the suppressed inflammatory responses as shown by downregulated serum tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 levels, and upregulated IL-10 level, as well as attenuated apoptosis as shown by decreased protein expression of cleaved caspase-3 and -9. In line with these results, SIN pretreatment also alleviatedthe hepatic histopathological changes in IR rats and induced Nrf-2/HO-1 activation. The use of brusatol, a selective inhibitor for Nrf-2, effectively reversed SIN-induced above effects.\\nAltogether, our results demonstrate that SIN might be a useful therapeutic drug for preventing hepatic IR-induced injury during clinical liver transplantation.\",\n",

Didymin has been reported to have a protective effect on intracerebral hemorrhage. However, the underlying mechanism of didymin on regulating cerebral IR injury remains largely unknown.\\nA rat cerebral IR model and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in PC12 cells were established. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) was used to detect the pathological changes in brain tissues, and TUNEL staining was performed to detect apoptosis of brain tissues. MTT and flow cytometry were used to measure the viability and apoptosis of PC12 cells. QRT-PCR and western blot were used to detect inflammation cytokines in PC12 cells. Western blot was used to measure the expression of PPAR-\\u03b3, RXRA, Bax, c-caspase-3, and Bcl-2.\\nDidymin pretreatment decreased apoptotic rates, reduced levels of Bax and c-caspase-3, and increased Bcl-2 level in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, didymin pretreatment increased viability and decreased the inflammation levels [interleukin (IL)-1\\u03b2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\\u03b1, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1] of OGD/R treated PC12 cells. Moreover, didymin activated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) signaling pathway and increased the expression of PPAR-\\u03b3 and RXRA in OGD/R treated PC12 cells. Inhibition of PPAR-\\u03b3 eliminated the protective effect of didymin on OGD/R treated cells.\\nDidymin protected neuron cells against IR injury in vitro and in vivo by activation of the PPAR pathway.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Studies of mitochondrial dynamics have identified an intriguing link between energy supply balance and mitochondrial architecture. This suggests that inappropriate culture conditions might inhibit mitochondrial functions, and affect embryonic development. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine whether in vitro culture (IVC) might affect mitochondrial function, distribution, organization (by Mitotracker Green), gene expression on RNA level (by qPCR), and protein expression and localization (by western blot and immunostaining) involved in regulation of mitochondrial functions. Mitochondria in 2-cell IVC embryos were less numerous compare to IN VIVO\\u00a0while the localization and distribution do not differ between the groups. Mitochondria of in vivo blastocysts formed elongated network along the cells, while in IVC were fragmented, rounded, and aggregated mainly in the perinuclear region. Additionally, mitochondria of IN VIVO embryos moved back and forth along their long axis on radial tracks, while in IVC blastocysts were much less active. mtDNA copy number in IVC blastocysts (92,336.65\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20095860.04) was significantly lower than that of IN VIVO (169,103.92\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200916,322.41; P\\u2009<\\u20090.02) as well as lower protein expressions responsible for mitochondrial fusion was observed in IVC blastocysts. Results indicate that in vitro culture affect on perturbations in mitochondrial number and function, which is associated with decreased developmental competence of in vitro produced mouse embryos.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy is a powerful adoptive immunotherapy against both B-cell malignancies and some types of solid tumors. Interleukin (IL) -15 is an important immune stimulator that may provide ideal long-term persistent CAR-T cells. However, higher base line or peak serum IL-15 levels are also related to severe toxicity, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and neurotoxicity.\\nWe successfully constructed CD19 specific armored CAR-T cells overexpressing IL-I5 and IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Ra). In vitro cell differentiation and viability were monitored by flow cytometry, and an in vivo xenograft mouse models was used to evaluate the anti-tumor efficiency and liver damage of CAR-T cells.\\nCAR-T cells overexpressing IL-15 alone demonstrated enhanced viability, retarded exhaustion in vitro and superior tumor-inhibitory effects in vivo. However, these tumor-free mice had lower survival rates, with serious liver injuries, as a possible result of toxicity. As expected, CAR-T cells overexpressing IL-15 combined with IL-15Ra had reduced CD132 expression and released fewer cytokines (IFN\\u03b3, IL-2 and IL-15) in vitro, as well as had the tendency to improve mouse survival via repressing the growth of tumor cells and keeping livers healthier compared to CAR-IL-15\\u00a0T cells.\\nThese results indicated the importance of IL-15 in enhancing T cells persistence and IL-15Ra in reducing the adverse effects of IL-15, with superior tumor retardation during CAR-T therapy. This study paves the way for the rapid exploitation of IL-15 in adoptive cell therapy in the future.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Alamandine (Ala) is the newest identified peptide of the renin-angiotensin system and has protective effect on myocyte hypertrophy. However, it is still unclear whether Ala can alleviate heart failure (HF). The aim of this study was to explore the effects of Ala on HF and the related cardiac fibrosis, and to probe the mechanism. HF model was induced by myocardial infarction (MI) in mice. Four weeks after MI, Ala was administrated by intraperitoneal injection for two weeks. Ala injection significantly improved cardiac dysfunction of MI mice in vivo. The cardiac fibrosis and the related biomarkers were attenuated after Ala administration in HF mice in vivo. The increases of collagen I, alpha-smooth muscle actin and transforming growth factor-beta induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts (NRCFs) were inhibited by Ala treatment in vitro. The biomarkers of apoptosis were elevated in NRCFs induced by OGD, which were attenuated after treating with Ala in vitro. The enhancement of oxidative stress in the heart of MI mice or in the NRCFs treated with OGD was suppressed by treating with Ala in vivo and in vitro. These effects of Ala were reversed by tBHP, an exogenous inducer of oxidative stress in vitro. These results demonstrated that Ala could alleviate cardiac dysfunction and attenuate cardiac fibrosis via inhibition of oxidative stress.\",\n",

We assessed the gut microbiota and faecal metabolome in a static animal model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\\nThis model was subjected to the following treatments: reverse osmosis water, AFO-202, N-163, AFO-202+N-163 and telmisartan treatment. Faecal samples were collected at 6 and 9 weeks of age. The gut microbiome was analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequences acquired by next-generation sequencing, and the faecal metabolome was analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.\\nGut microbial diversity increased greatly in the AFO-202+N-163 group. Postintervention, the abundance of Firmicutes decreased, whereas that of Bacteroides increased and was the highest in the AFO-202+N-163 group. The decrease in the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and other Firmicutes and the abundance of Turicibacter and Bilophila were the highest in the AFO-202 and N-163 groups, respectively.

Nonhuman primates play important roles in the study of brain science because of their neural and vascular similarity to humans. However, there are few research results of three-photon fluorescence microscopy on the brain of nonhuman primates due to the lack of optimized imaging systems and excellent fluorescent probes. Here we introduced a bright aggregation-induced emission (AIE) probe with excellent three-photon fluorescence efficiency as well as facile synthesis process and we validated its biocompatibility in the macaque monkey. We achieved a large-depth vascular imaging of approximately 1\\u00a0mm in the cerebral cortex of macaque monkey with our lab-modified three-photon fluorescence microscopy system and the AIE probe. Functional measurement of blood velocity in deep cortex capillaries was also performed. Furthermore, the comparison of cortical deep vascular structure parameters across species was presented on the monkey and mouse cortex. This work is the first in vivo three-photon fluorescence microscopic imaging research on the macaque monkey cortex reaching the imaging depth of \\u223c1\\u00a0mm with the bright AIE probe. The results demonstrate the potential of three-photon microscopy as primate-compatible method for imaging fine vascular networks and will advance our understanding of vascular function in normal and disease in humans.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is defined as a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause. Interleukin (IL)-11 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we explore whether a potential antifibrotic agent fluorofenidone (FD) exerts its anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects through suppressing activation of the IL-11/MEK/ERK signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro. Male C57BL/6 J mice were intratracheally injected with bleomycin or saline. Fluorofenidone was administered throughout the course of the experiment. Lung tissue sections were stained with hemotoxylin and eosin, and Masson trichrome. Cytokines were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The \\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\\u03b1-SMA), fibronectin, and collagen I were measured using immunohistochemistry, and the phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase, IL-11RA, and gp130 were measured using Western blot. The RAW264.7 cells and the normal human lung fibroblasts were treated with IL-11 and/or FD, IL-11RA-siRNA, or MEK inhibitor. The expressions of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase, IL-11RA, gp130, \\u03b1-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen I were measured using Western blot and/or real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results showed that FD markedly reduced the expressions of IL-8, IL-18, IL-11, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, \\u03b1-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen I in mice lung tissues. In addition, FD attenuated IL-11-induced expressions of \\u03b1-SMA, fibronectin, and collagen I and inhibited IL-11RA, gp130, and phosphorylation of the ERK and MEK protein expression, as well as reduced the expressions of IL-8, IL-18, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 in vitro. This study demonstrated that FD attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mice by inhibiting the IL-11/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Endotoxin tolerance is a state of hyporesponsiveness to LPS, triggered by previous exposure to endotoxin. Such an immunosuppressive state enhances the risks of secondary infection and has been associated with the pathophysiology of sepsis. Although this phenomenon has been extensively studied, its molecular mechanism is not fully explained. Among candidates that play a crucial role in this process are negative regulators of TLR signaling, but the contribution of MCP-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1; Regnase-1) has not been studied yet. To examine whether macrophage expression of MCPIP1 participates in endotoxin tolerance, we used both murine and human primary macrophages devoid of MCPIP1 expression. In our study, we demonstrated that MCPIP1 contributes to LPS hyporesponsiveness induced by subsequent LPS stimulation and macrophage reprogramming. We proved that this mechanism revolves around the deubiquitinase activity of MCPIP1, which inhibits the phosphorylation of MAPK and NF-\\u03baB activation. Moreover, we showed that MCPIP1 controlled the level of proinflammatory transcripts in LPS-tolerized cells independently of its RNase activity. Finally, we confirmed these findings applying an in vivo endotoxin tolerance model in wild-type and myeloid MCPIP1-deficient mice. Taken together, this study describes for the first time, to our knowledge, that myeloid MCPIP1 participates in endotoxin tolerance and broadens the scope of known negative regulators of the TLR4 pathway crucial in this phenomenon.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Mouse models of active systemic anaphylaxis rely predominantly on IgG Abs forming IgG-allergen immune complexes that induce IgG receptor-expressing neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages to release potent mediators, leading to systemic effects. Whether anaphylaxis initiates locally or systemically remains unknown. In this study, we aimed at identifying the anatomical location of IgG-allergen immune complexes during anaphylaxis. Active systemic anaphylaxis was induced following immunization with BSA and i.v. challenge with fluorescently labeled BSA. Ag retention across different organs was examined using whole-body fluorescence imaging, comparing immunized and naive animals. Various mouse models and in vivo deletion strategies were employed to determine the contribution of IgG receptors, complement component C1q, myeloid cell types, and anaphylaxis mediators. We found that following challenge, Ag diffused systemically, but specifically accumulated in the lungs of mice sensitized to that Ag, where it formed large Ab-dependent aggregates in the vasculature. Ag retention in the lungs did not rely on IgG receptors, C1q, neutrophils, or macrophages. IgG2a-mediated, but neither IgG1- nor IgG2b-mediated, passive systemic anaphylaxis led to Ag retention in the lung. Neutrophils and monocytes significantly accumulated in the lungs after challenge and captured high amounts of Ag, which led to downmodulation of surface IgG receptors and triggered their activation. Thus, within minutes of systemic injection in sensitized mice, Ag formed aggregates in the lung and liver vasculature, but accumulated specifically and dose-dependently in the lung. Neutrophils and monocytes recruited to the lung captured Ag and became activated. However, Ag aggregation in the lung vasculature was not necessary for anaphylaxis induction.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Changes in metabolic pathways are often associated with the development of a wide range of pathologies. Increased glycolysis under conditions of sufficient tissue oxygen supply and its dissociation from the Krebs cycle, known as aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect, is a hallmark of many malignant neoplasms. Identification of specific metabolic shifts can characterize the metabolic programming of individual types of tumor cells, the stage of their transformation, and predict their metastatic potential. Viral infection can also alter the metabolism of cells to support the process of viral replication. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with an increased incidence of various cancers, and for some viral proteins a direct oncogenic effect was demonstrated. In particular, we showed that the expression of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) in 4T1 breast adenocarcinoma cells increases the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of cells in vitro and in vivo by a mechanism associated with the ability of RT to induce reactive oxygen species in cells (ROS). The aim of this work was to study the molecular mechanism of this process, namely the effect of HIV-1 RT on the key metabolic pathways associated with tumor progression: glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Expression of HIV-1 RT had no effect on the glycolysis process. At the same time, it led to an increase in mitochondrial respiration and the level of ATP synthesis in the cell, while not affecting the availability of the substrates, carbon donors for the Krebs cycle, which excludes the effect of RT on the metabolic enzymes of cells. Increased mitochondrial respiration was associated with restoration of the mitochondrial network despite the RT-induced reduction in mitochondrial mass. Increased mitochondrial respiration may increase cell motility, which explains their increased tumorigenicity and metastatic potential. These data are important for understanding the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, including the stimulation of the formation and spread of HIV-1 associated malignancies.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"One of the most important steps in the development of drugs and vaccines against a new coronavirus infection is their testing on a relevant animal model. The laboratory mouse, with well-studied immunology, is the preferred mammalian model in experimental medicine. However, mice are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to the lack of human angiotensin-converting enzyme (hACE2), which is the cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and necessary for the entry of the virus into the cell. In present work, it was shown that intranasal administration of the adeno-associated vectors AAV9 and AAV-DJ encoding the hACE2 provided a high level of expression of ACE2 gene in the lungs of mice. In contrast, the introduction of the AAV6 vector led to a low level ACE2 expression. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 of mice expressing hACE2 in the lungs led to virus replication and development of bronchopneumonia on the 7th day after infection. Thus, a simple method for delivering the human ACE2 gene to mouse lungs by intranasal administration of the AAV vector has been proposed. This approach enabled rapid generation of mouse model for studying coronavirus infection.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Viruses are now recognized as bona fide etiologic factors of human cancer. Carcinogenic viruses include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1, indirectly), and several candidate human cancer viruses. It is estimated that 15% of all human tumors worldwide are caused by viruses. Tumor viruses establish long-term persistent infections in humans, and cancer is an accidental side effect of viral replication strategies. Viruses are usually not complete carcinogens, supporting the concept that cancer results from the accumulation of multiple cooperating events, in which human cancer viruses display different, often opposing roles. The laboratory mouse Mus musculus is one of the best in vivo experimental systems for modeling human pathology, including viral infections and cancer. However, mice are unsusceptible to infection with the known carcinogenic viruses. Many murine models were developed to overcome this limitation and to address various aspects of virus-associated carcinogenesis, from tumors resulting from xenografts of human tissues and cells, including cancerous and virus infected, to genetically engineered mice susceptible to viral infections and associated cancer. The review considers the main existing models, analyzes their advantages and drawbacks, describes their applications, outlines the prospects of their further development.\",\n",

The six components showed good linear relationship within the corresponding concentration ranges, and the method showed high specificity, accuracy, precision, and stability. Their pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by DAS 3.2.2, and the results showed that the in vivo metabolic processes of the six components accorded with the characteristics of non-compartmental model. When Jiaotai Pills and Fluoxetine were used together, the AUC_(0-t), AUC_(0-\\u221e), C_(max), and C_(av) of magnoflorine all significantly increased(P&lt;0.05), while the pharmacokinetic trend of berberrubine was opposite to that of magnoflorine, as manifested by the decrease in AUC_(0-t), AUC_(0-\\u221e), T_(max), C_(max), and C_(av)(P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05). The pharmacokinetic characteristics of jatrorrhizine, coptisine, and berberine followed the trend of berberrubine. There was no significant difference in the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Fluoxetine in the single or combination groups. This study suggests that the enhanced antidepressant efficacy of Jiaotai Pills and Fluo-xetine may be attributed to the pharmacokinetic interaction.\",\n",

Saponins and flavonoids are the main active components in C. chinense. To study the pharmacokine-tics of multiple components from the total extract of C. chinense(TEC), we established a sensitive and rapid method of ultra-perfor-mance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry(UPLC-MS/MS) for simultaneous determination of five compounds in the plasma of AUB rats. After validation, the AUB model was established with SD female rats which got pregnant on the same day by gavage with mifepristone(12.4 mg\\u00b7kg~(-1)) and misoprostol(130 \\u03bcg\\u00b7kg~(-1)). The established method was applied to the detection of hesperidin, naringenin, apigenin, saikosaponin a, and buddlejasaponin \\u2163b in AUB rats after the administration of TEC. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by DAS 2.0. The five compounds showed good linear relationship within the detection range. The specificity, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effect, and stability of the method all matched the requirements of biolo-gical sample detection. The above 5 compounds were detected in the plasma of AUB rats after the administration of TEC. The C_(max) va-lues of hesperidin, naringenin, apigenin, saikosaponin a, and clinoposide A were 701.6, 429.5, 860.7, 75.1, and 304.1 ng\\u00b7mL~(-1), respectively. All the compounds owned short half-life and quick elimination rate in vivo, and the large apparent volume of distribution indicated that they were widely distributed in tissues. Being rapid, accurate, and sensitive, this method is suitable for the pharmacokinetic study of extracts of Chinese herbal medicines and provides a reference for the study of pharmacodynamic material basis of C. chinense in treating AUB.\",\n",

It is based on the Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma-Puerariae Lobatae Radix herb pair with salvianolic acids, tanshinones and pueraria flavonoids as main components. Studying the chemical composition in vivo of Dangefentong Capsules and its metabolites is of great significance for making clear its pharmacodynamic material basis and the action mechanism. The UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap-MS/MS was applied to rapidly analyze the metabolites and metabolic pathways of Dangefentong Capsules in Beagle dogs after gavage. Eclipse plus C_(18) column(2.1 mm\\u00d750 mm, 1.8 \\u03bcm) was used, and gradient elution was performed with 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution(A)-formic acid acetonitrile solution(B). A heated electrospray ion source(HESI) was employed. The scanning mode was set as the positive and negative ion mode, and the mass scanning range was m/z 100-1 000. The plasma, urine and feces samples were collected after male Beagle dogs were administered with Dangefentong Capsules. The prototype components and metabolites were identified by UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap-MS/MS analysis combined with reference substances and references. The results showed that 107 chemical components were identified, including 58 prototype components and 49 metabolites. The identified prototype components included 42 components from Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma and 16 components from Puerariae Lobatae Radix. The metabolites consist of 21 and 28 metabolites of Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma and Puerariae Lobatae Radix, respectively. They are mainly derived from the methylation, hydroxylation, sulfation and glucuronidation of salvianolic acids, tanshinones and pueraria flavonoids. This research rapi-dly analyzes the chemical components in vivo of Beagle dogs administered with Dangefentong Capsules, laying a basis for illustrating the pharmacodynamic material basis and mechanism of Dangefentong Capsules.\",\n",

First, the potential targets of MT in the treatment of bronchial asthma were predicted based on network pharmacology, and the &quot;Chinese medicine-active component-target-pathway-disease&quot; network was constructed, followed by Gene Oncology(GO) term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) pathway enrichment of the potential targets. Molecular docking was used to determine the binding activity of key candidate active components to hub genes. Ovalbumin(OVA, intraperitoneal injection for sensitization and nebulization for excitation) was used to induce bronchial asthma in rats. Rats were classified into control group(CON), model group(M), dexamethasone group(DEX, 0.075 mg\\u00b7kg~(-1)), and MT(1\\u22361.5) group. Hematoxylin and eosin(HE), Masson, and periodic acid-Schiff(PAS) staining were performed to observe the effect of MT on pathological changes of lungs and trachea and goblet cell proliferation in asthma rats. The levels of transforming growth factor(TGF)-\\u03b21, interleukin(IL)6, and IL10 in rat serum were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA), and the mRNA and protein levels of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8(MAPK8), cyclin D1(CCND1), IL6, epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3 K), and protein kinase B(Akt) by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Network pharmacology predicted that MAPK8, CCND1, IL6, and EGFR were the potential targets of MT in the treatment of asthma, which may be related to PI3 K/Akt signaling pathway. Quercetin and \\u03b2-sitosterol in MT acted on a lot of targets related to asthma, and molecular docking results showed that quercetin and \\u03b2-sitosterol had strong binding activity to MAPK, PI3 K, and Akt. In vivo experiment showed that MT could effectively alleviate the symptoms of OVA-induced asthma rats, improve the pathological changes of lung tissue, reduce the production of goblet cells, inhibit the inflammatory response of asthma rats, suppress the expression of MAPK8, CCND1, IL6, and EGFR, and regulate the PI3 K/Akt signaling pathway. Therefore, MT may relieve the symptoms and inhibit inflammation of asthma rats by regulating the PI3 K/Akt signaling pathway, and quercetin and \\u03b2-sitosterol are the candidate active components.\",\n",

The main active ingredients and targets of AGTF, as well as disease targets, were screened out using relevant databases and literature data. The &quot;protein-protein interaction&quot;(PPI) network and &quot;drug-ingredient-target-pathway&quot; network were constructed, and the potential targets and mechanism of AGTF against GA were predicted. The hyperuricemia(HUA) combined with GA model was induced in rats. The gait behaviors of rats were scored, and ankle swelling degree was observed. The uric acid(UA) level and xanthine oxidase(XOD) activity in the rat serum were detected, and the levels of interleukin-1\\u03b2(IL-1\\u03b2), interleukin-6(IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1(TNF-\\u03b1) were measured. The protein expression of toll-like receptor 4(TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88(MyD88), and nuclear factor-kappa B(NF-\\u03baB) in the synovial tissues of the rat ankle joint was determined by immunohistochemistry. Ten active ingredients of AGTF and 73 candidate targets of AGTF against GA were screened out by network pharmacology. Eighty-six signaling pathways were enriched, including TNF signaling pathway, NF-\\u03baB signaling pathway, TLR signaling pathway, Nod-like receptor signaling pathway, and purine metabolism signaling pathway, which were closely related to AGTF against GA. Animal experimental results showed that AGTF could effectively improve the abnormal gait behaviors of GA rats, relieve ankle inflammation, and reduce ankle joint swelling. In addition, AGTF could significantly reduce UA level, inhibit XOD activity, decrease TNF-\\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\\u03b2 content, and down-regulate the expression of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-\\u03baB in ankle synovial tissues(P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01). The results of network pharmacology and experimental validation are consistent, indicating that AGTF exerts its therapeutic effect on GA by regulating UA metabolism, improving abnormal UA level, reducing the release of inflammatory factors, and regulating immunity and the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\\u03baB inflammatory pathway.\",\n",

Chondrocytes were isolated from 2-3 week-old male SD rats and lipopolysaccharide(LPS) was used to induce OA in chondrocytes in vitro. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium(MTT) assay was used to investigate the toxicity of seven alkaloids(12-epi-napelline, songorine, benzoylaconine, aconitine, 3-acetylaconitine, mesaconitine, and benzoylmesaconine) to chondrocytes. Chondrocytes were classified into the control group, model group(induced by LPS 5 \\u03bcg\\u00b7mL~(-1) for 12 h), and administration groups(induced by LPS 5 \\u03bcg\\u00b7mL~(-1) for 12 h and incubated for 24 h). The protein expression of inflammatory factors cyclooxygenase-2(COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthetase(iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1(TNF-\\u03b1), and interleukin-1\\u03b2(IL-1\\u03b2) in each group were detected by Western blot, and the protein expression of matrix metalloprotease-13(MMP-13), aggrecan, collagen \\u2161, fibroblast growth factor 2(FGF2) by immunofluorescence staining. For the in vivo experiment, sodium iodoacetate was used to induce OA in rats, and the expression of MMP-13, TNF-\\u03b1, and FGF2 in cartilage tissues of rats in each group was detected by immunohistochemistry. The results showed that the viability of chondrocytes could reach more than 90% under the treatment of the seven alkaloids in a certain dose range. Aconitine, 12-epi-napelline, songorine, 3-acetylaconitine, and mesaconitine could decrease the protein expression of inflammatory factors COX-2, iNOS, TNF-\\u03b1 and IL-1\\u03b2 compared with the model group. Moreover, 12-epi-napelline, aconitine, and mesaconitine could down-regulate the expression of MMP-13 and up-regulate the expression of aggrecan and collagen \\u2161. In addition, compared with the model group and other Bangna alkaloids, 12-epi-napelline significantly up-regulated the expression of FGF2. Therefore, 12-epi-napelline was selected for the animal experiment in vivo. Immunohistochemistry results showed that 12-epi-napelline could significantly reduce the expression of MMP-13 and TNF-\\u03b1 in cartilage tissues, and up-regulate the expression of FGF2 compared with the model group. In conclusion, among the seven Bangna alkaloids, 12-epi-napelline can promote the repair of OA in rats by down-regulating the expression of MMP-13 and TNF-\\u03b1 and up-regulating the expression of FGF2.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"This study aimed to explore the protective effect of Reduning Injection(RDN) on mice infected by influenza virus A/PR/8(PR8) and its immune regulatory roles during viral infection. In in vivo experiments, female C57 BL/6 mice were randomly divided into phosphate buffered saline(PBS) group, PR8-infected group, oseltamivir treatment group(OSV) and RDN treatment group. After 2 h of PR8 infection, mice in the oseltamivir group were gavaged with oseltamivir 30 mg\\u00b7kg~(-1), and those in the RDN treatment group were injected intraperitoneally with RDN 1.5 mL\\u00b7kg~(-1)once per day for seven consecutive days. The body weight of mice in each group was recorded at the same time every morning for 16 consecutive days. The line chart of body weight change was created to analyze the protective effect of RDN on flu-infected mice. The relative mRNA expression of different cytokines(IL-6, TNF-\\u03b1, MCP-1, IL-1\\u03b2, MIP-2, IP-10 and IL-10) in lung samples of flu-infected mice was detected by PCR. Flow cytometry was utilized to analyze the composition of immune cells of mouse BALF samples on day 5 after infection. Mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was planted and treated by different concentrations of RDN(150, 300, 600 \\u03bcg\\u00b7mL~(-1)) for 24 h or 48 h, and cell proliferation was detected by CCK-8 assay. RAW264.7 cells and mouse primary peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with synthetic single stranded RNA(R837), which elicited the inflammatory response by mimicking the infection of single-stranded RNA viruses. The expression of cytokines and chemokines in the supernatants of above culture system was detected by ELISA and qPCR. On days 4, 5, 6, 7 and 15 after infection, the body weight loss of mice in the RDN treatment group was alleviated compared with that of PR8-infected mice(P&lt;0.05). RDN treatment obviously reduced lung index and the production of IL-6, TNF-\\u03b1, MCP-1 and MIP-2 in lung tissues of flu-infected mice(P&lt;0.05). The proportions of macrophages, neutrophils and T cells in mouse BALF samples were analyzed by flow cytometry, and compared with PR8-infected mice, RDN decreased the proportion of macrophages in BALF of flu-infected mice(P&lt;0.05), and the proportion of T cells was recovered dramatically(P&lt;0.001). In CCK-8 assay, the concentrations of RDN(150, 300, 600 \\u03bcg\\u00b7mL~(-1)) failed to cause cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells. In addition, RDN lowered the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-\\u03b1,MCP-1, IL-1\\u03b2, RANTES, and IP-10 and even anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in R837-induced macrophages. RDN reduced the infiltration of inflammatory macrophages and the production of excessive inflammatory cytokines, alleviated the body weight loss of flu-infected mice. What's more, RDN restored the depletion of T cells, which might prevent secondary infection and deteriorative progression of the disease. Taken together, RDN may inhibit cytokine production and therefore down-regulate cytokine storm during the infection of influenza virus.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy revolutionized the treatment of refractory B cell malignancies, but relapses occur through a variety of incompletely understood mechanisms. Currently, tracking CAR-T expansion and persistence in patients is limited to peripheral blood sampling, but this approach provides no insights into how and where CAR-T cells traffic beyond the peripheral blood or how cellular localization may impact persistence and efficacy. Furthermore, costimulatory endodomains that are known to influence CAR-T cell phenotype have unclear downstream effects on how CAR-T cells traffic. The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is a plasma membrane glycoprotein that actively uptakes iodide and its analogs, and it can be transduced into various cell types in preclinical models allowing sensitive and specific PET/SPECT imaging. Coexpression of NIS with CAR on T cells would allow real-time, in vivo imaging of CAR-T cells and aid in understanding CAR-T cell biology and trafficking.\\nUsing Golden Gate modular vector construction, multiple anti-CD20 CAR constructs with specificity for both human and non-human primate (NHP) CD20 antigens were generated. Each construct included one of several costimulatory domains (4-1BB, CD28, or CD27), a standard CD3-zeta signaling domain, and either the rhesus-NIS reporter or truncated EGFR following a short ribosomal skip sequence peptide, allowing transduction under control of the same EF1a promoter. CAR was effectively cotransduced with NIS in both human and NHP primary T cells with no effect of NIS on CAR-T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against CD20-expressing Raji cells in vitro compared to control. Cytotoxicity was antigen-specific as no difference was seen against CD20- control cells. Functional iodide and [\\nAn NSG mouse xenograft model will be used to track the localization, expansion, efficacy, and persistence of CAR-T constructs against Raji lymphoma cells. Different costimulatory domains appear to elicit only slight differences in cytokine production in vitro but will be further studied for differences in efficacy and trafficking in vivo in mice and later in a syngeneic NHP model.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"There are chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients who show resistance to TKI therapy and are prone to progress to more advanced phases of the disease, and new therapeutic approaches are needed. Our study shows that CML cells are vulnerable to dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibition mediated by Meds433, a potent DHODH inhibitor developed by our group.\\nPyrimidine supply in resting and differentiated cells primarily relies on the salvage pyrimidine pathway, which is energetically affordable. This level of nucleotide production for fast-proliferating leukemic cells is insufficient, and they have to fulfill their needs via the de novo pathway. In this study, we shed light on the role of DHODH inhibition in CML and how it can be a promising approach for targeting leukemic cells.\\nSixty bone marrow samples and peripheral blood of newly diagnosed CML patients and 4 TKI-resistant patients were collected. In-vivo, in-vitro, and ex-vivo experiments were performed on primary CML CD34+ and various CML cell lines.\\nOur data showed that DHODH is highly active in CML stem/progenitor cells, which supports a high proliferation capacity. Meds433, by targeting DHODH enzyme activity, induced apoptosis, cell growth, and cell cycle arrest in leukemic cells. Meanwhile, the administration of Meds433 reduced tumor growth and tumor burden in treated mice. Interestingly, the addition of exogenous uridine rescued all of the biological effects caused by DHODH inhibition, demonstrating the selectivity of Meds433. Based on RNA-seq data, most upregulated gene sets were related to apoptosis and immune response and most downregulated gene sets were related to MYC targets and metabolism pathways, which was confirmed by metabolic profile analysis. Also, we found that glutamic pyruvic acid transaminase 1 (GPT1) is among the top downregulated genes after treating CML cells with Meds433, and overexpressing GPT1 in CML cells interfered with the effect of Meds433. These data show that GPT1 downregulation could be one of the possible mechanisms in which Meds433 acts in CML.\\nOur study shows that DHODH inhibition is a promising approach for targeting CML stem/progenitor cells and may help more patients discontinue the therapy.

Meanwhile, the administration of Meds433 reduced tumor growth and tumor burden in treated mice. Interestingly, the addition of exogenous uridine rescued all of the biological effects caused by DHODH inhibition, demonstrating the selectivity of Meds433. Based on RNA-seq data, most upregulated gene sets were related to apoptosis and immune response and most downregulated gene sets were related to MYC targets and metabolism pathways, which was confirmed by metabolic profile analysis. Also, we found that glutamic pyruvic acid transaminase 1 (GPT1) is among the top downregulated genes after treating CML cells with Meds433, and overexpressing GPT1 in CML cells interfered with the effect of Meds433. These data show that GPT1 downregulation could be one of the possible mechanisms in which Meds433 acts in CML.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Evidence has emerged demonstrating an association between treatment with certain tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and vascular adverse events (VAEs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). An increase in VAEs has been documented with ponatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib but not with imatinib and bosutinib. We used an endothelial cell (HUVEC) model and an in-vivo hindlimb ischemia mouse model to study TKI-associated VAEs. We show that compared with control-treated cells, ponatinib increased HUVEC apoptosis by 97% and inhibited their VEGF-induced migration by 35%. HUVEC tube formation was significantly abrogated by ponatinib as evidenced by an 87% reduction in tube number, 68% reduction in segment length, 50% reduction in junction number, and 55% increase in the occurrence of isolated segments. Ponatinib's suppressive effect on tube formation was partially rescued by VEGFR2 overexpression, a known ponatinib off-target. Dasatinib also dramatically disrupted tube formation as evidenced by a 97% reduction in tube number, 95% reduction in segment length, 88% reduction in junction number, and 300% increase in the occurrence of isolated segments. Nilotinib was associated with reduced cell viability, whereas imatinib and bosutinib did not affect these processes. Furthermore, HUVECs treated with ponatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib revealed a differential angiogenesis-related gene expression pattern. The expression profile of imatinib- and bosutinib-treated cells was similar to that of control-treated cells. In our in-vivo model, unilateral femoral artery excision was performed to induce ischemia and stimulate new blood vessel formation in TKI-treated mice. Imatinib-treated mice showed a similar recovery pattern to that of control mice as assessed via Doppler imager. Bosutinib- and dasatinib-treated mice showed an initial delayed recovery but reached an overall recovery of 85% within 28 days. In contrast, ponatinib-treated mice reached overall perfusion of 60% around day 7 without further improvement. These results are in line with the clinical VAE profiles of ponatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, implicating endothelial toxicity related to these TKIs and supporting a direct effect of these TKIs on vascular cells. However, the in-vivo effect of these TKIs on endothelial pathogenesis requires further investigation. Understanding TKI-induced VAE pathogenesis could contribute to the future development of safer next-generation TKIs and could potentially influence TKI-personalized tailoring for CML patients.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"CD123 is overexpressed on AML blasts compared to healthy myeloid progenitor cells. There is opportunity to design anti-CD123 therapy to discriminate on antigen density. Our goal is to study affinity modification of the single chain variable fragment (scFv) in the context of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified NK cell activation and target killing. We hypothesize that lower affinity CAR-NK cells will demonstrate improved discrimination between tumor and healthy tissue.\\nWe designed NK-cell specific CARs to contain anti-CD123 scFvs binding distinct target epitopes (26292 or 7G3) fused to intracellular portions of NK-activating receptors 4-1BB.CD3Z and 2B4.CD3Z. We synthesized novel 26292 and known 7G3 variants to capture a spectrum of CD123 binding affinities (26292: Kd=15nM; variant Kd range 0.29-160nM; 7G3: Kd=8.75nM; variant Kd range 23.9-64.9nM). These scFv were generated using site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type sequences and subcloned into CAR backbones. Retroviral transduction of primary human NK cells was performed, and CAR expression was measured using FACS (range 23.9%-89.6% CAR+ NK cells). Raji target cells (CD123neg) were engineered and sorted to obtain model cell lines with stable low (Raji.Low) and high (Raji. High) CD123 expression, comparable to healthy cells (CD123.Low) and AML blasts (CD123.High). We tested CAR-NK cell activation and antigen-specific cytotoxicity using in vitro co-culture assays. We established a mouse model of disease using implantation of Raji cells engineered to express firefly Luciferase (Raji.ffLuc).\\nAntitumor cytotoxicity of 26292 and 7G3-based CAR-NK cells with a range of binding affinities showed CAR-specific activation but did not differentiate on target antigen density. Similarly, no differences were seen in CAR-NK activation as measured by TNFa and IFNy secretion following coculture with CD123-positive cells. NSG mice implanted with Raji.ffLuc had median survival of 42 days without treatment.\\nThere are no significant differences across a broad range of variable affinity 26292 and 7G3-based anti-CD123 CAR-NK cells in effector cell activation or target killing when assayed short-term. These data support the value of additional long-term investigation of the immune synapse and CAR-NK antitumor activity in vivo.

We treated AML cell lines with FLT3-WT or -ITD mutations with ALK2 inhibitors and measured their effect on cell cycle and proliferation. To determine the mechanism of TP-0184, we measured the activation of FLT3 downstream signaling by using western blotting and RNA sequencing. Further, we performed kinase profiling to understand the binding specificity of TP-0184 with 11 different FLT3 mutants. Finally, we investigated the effect of TP-0184 on AML growth in vivo using FLT3-mutated PDX and xenograft models.\\nAnalysis of AML datasets showed that ALK2 is significantly upregulated in AML patients with FLT3 mutations compared to those with WT-FLT3 (P<0.00001) and predicts poor overall survival (P=0.05). Treatment of FLT3-WT and -mutated AML cell lines with the ALK2 inhibitors LDN-212854 and TP-0184 resulted in significant inhibition of FLT3-ITD-mutant cell growth at low concentrations (IC50<25 nM), while WT-FLT3 cells were affected only at high concentrations (IC50>100 nM). Interestingly, TP-0184 induced G1/G0 arrest in AML cell lines with FLT-ITD mutations but had minimal to no effect in FLT3-WT AML cells. Further, we observed that treatment with TP-0184 in AML cell lines significantly inhibited multiple signaling proteins downstream of FLT3, such as p-STAT5 and p-ERK, as well as p-PI3K, p-mTOR, and p-S6K. Gene expression analysis revealed that treatment with TP-0184 in FLT3-ITD cell lines significantly downregulated the serine biosynthesis pathway. Lastly, treatment with TP-0184 significantly prolonged the survival of FLT3-ITD-mutated AML-bearing mice (P<0.0001).\\nOur data indicate that ALK2 is a prognostic marker in FLT3-mutated AML. TP-0184 inhibits cell proliferation by inhibiting FLT3 downstream signaling pathways in AML cells. Kinase assays confirmed that TP-0184 is a highly specific FLT3-ALK2 dual inhibitor. TP-0184 inhibits AML growth in FLT3-mutated PDX and xenograft models.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The oncoprotein c-Myc governs epigenome and transcriptome and is deregulated in 70% of all human cancers. MYC is highly expressed in TP53 mutant or venetoclax (ven) resistant AML (Sallman, Blood 2021, Nishida, ASH 2021). However, targeting c-Myc or the MYC pathway has not been met with success. PROTACs or cerebron E3 ligase modulators (CELMoDs) are attractive modalities to specifically target hitherto undruggable oncoproteins.\\nWe developed the first c-Myc degrader GT19630 (GT19715, the salt form of GT19630). We tested it in cell-free, cellular assays and in animal studies.\\nGT19630 effectively degraded oncogenic c-Myc protein (IC50 = 1.5 nM) in HL-60 cells. C-Myc was effectively pulled down by biotinylated GT19630 in a cell-free, in vitro affinity purification assay; and a proteasome inhibitor ixazomib completely blocked c-Myc degradation. IC50 of GT19715 in HL-60 cells was 1.8 nM, being considerably lower than 40.2 nM, an IC50 of normal myeloid progenitors in CFU assay, suggesting a therapeutic window. GT19630 shares chemical properties with other CELMoDs and proteomic analyses revealed degradation of translation termination factor G1 to S phase transition proteins 1 (GSPT1), an important factor in LSC survival (Surka et al. Blood 2021). Indeed, GT19630 effectively degrades GSPT1 along with complete degradation of c-Myc in a xenograft model with HL-60 cells, and inhibits tumor growth at a dose as low as 0.3 mg/kg/bid. GT19630 had no effect on normal myeloid lineages in rats at 6 mg/kg. GT19715 eliminates circulating blasts and prolongs survival in the c-Myc-driven systemic Daudi leukemia/lymphoma model. Importantly, GT19715 induces cell killing independent of TP53 status, and baseline c-Myc protein levels significantly correlated with sensitivity to GT19715 in MOLM-13 cells with CRISPR engineered knockout or mutations of TP53 (R2 = 0.86, P = 0.02). We found that MV4;11 ven resistant (VR) cells demonstrated elevated protein levels of c-Myc, and GSPT1 and exhibited greater sensitivity to GT19715compared to ven-sensitive parental cells. Finally, GT19715 significantly reduced human CD45+ AML blasts compared to vehicle control in vivo in an AML PDX model.\\nFirst results with the novel dual c-Myc/GSPT1 degrader GT19715 demonstrate promising preclinical anti-lymphoma and -leukemia efficacy, providing rationale for its clinical development.\",\n",

C-Myc was effectively pulled down by biotinylated GT19630 in a cell-free, in vitro affinity purification assay; and a proteasome inhibitor ixazomib completely blocked c-Myc degradation. IC50 of GT19715 in HL-60 cells was 1.8 nM, being considerably lower than 40.2 nM, an IC50 of normal myeloid progenitors in CFU assay, suggesting a therapeutic window. GT19630 shares chemical properties with other CELMoDs and proteomic analyses revealed degradation of translation termination factor G1 to S phase transition proteins 1 (GSPT1), an important factor in LSC survival (Surka et al. Blood 2021). Indeed, GT19630 effectively degrades GSPT1 along with complete degradation of c-Myc in a xenograft model with HL-60 cells, and inhibits tumor growth at a dose as low as 0.3 mg/kg/bid. GT19630 had no effect on normal myeloid lineages in rats at 6 mg/kg. GT19715 eliminates circulating blasts and prolongs survival in the c-Myc-driven systemic Daudi leukemia/lymphoma model. Importantly, GT19715 induces cell killing independent of TP53 status, and baseline c-Myc protein levels significantly correlated with sensitivity to GT19715 in MOLM-13 cells with CRISPR engineered knockout or mutations of TP53 (R2 = 0.86, P = 0.02). We found that MV4;11 ven resistant (VR) cells demonstrated elevated protein levels of c-Myc, and GSPT1 and exhibited greater sensitivity to GT19715compared to ven-sensitive parental cells. Finally, GT19715 significantly reduced human CD45+ AML blasts compared to vehicle control in vivo in an AML PDX model.\",\n",

UROD is a cytosolic enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway involved in converting cytosolic uroporphyrinogen III into the key heme biosynthetic intermediate, coproporphyrinogen III. In an analysis of RNA-seq data from over 2,000 acute leukemia samples, UROD was significantly overexpressed and active by a data-driven network inference algorithm in AEL compared to other leukemia subtypes. We validated UROD as a dependency by electroporation of Cas9 and synthetic sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complex in the two screened cell lines, additional mouse leukemia cell lines, and two commercially available human AEL cell lines. Targeted knockout of UROD resulted in decreased tumor cell growth and viability compared to the non-targeting guide control cells. Sequencing analysis showed high editing efficiency (>85%) followed by recovery of the wildtype cells, indicating that UROD is a dependency in these cells. These results correlated with a significant increase of necrotic cells preceding loss of editing in the two tested human cell lines. We also observed an increase in ALAS1 expression, which is negatively regulated by cellular heme, indicating that UROD knockout leukemic cells cannot generate heme, leading to necrotic cell death. Moreover, mitochondrial function assays showed significant decreases in basal respiration, ATP production, maximal respiration, and spare capacity in a time-dependent manner, followed by the rescue of mitochondrial function after loss of editing efficiency and re-expression of UROD. We have recently developed homozygous UROD-dTAG engineered human AEL cell lines to perform in-vivo survival studies.\\nThrough whole-genome CRISPR knockout screening and functional studies, we show that UROD is a dependency in AEL and provides a basis for exploring its therapeutic inhibition.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"NPM1-mutated AML (NPM1c AML) is characterized by cytoplasmic delocalization of mutant NPM1 (NPM1c) and high expression of HOX genes, which are both mediated by XPO1 and critical for the leukemic phenotype. XPO1 inhibition by selinexor (seli) leads to NPM1c nuclear relocalization, loss of HOX expression, and terminal differentiation. However, 2 days/week seli did not result in evident benefit for NPM1c AML patients. We hypothesize that prolonged XPO1 inhibition is necessary to achieve optimal antileukemic activity. Since the newer XPO1 inhibitor eltanexor (elta) is given 5 days/week in early-phase clinical studies, we compared the antileukemic effects of intermittent (2d/w) and prolonged (5d/w) XPO1 inhibition in NPM1c AML models.\\nParental OCI-AML3 cells and CRISPR-edited OCI-AML3 cells with endogenous NPM1 fused to GFP (NPM1c-GFP) were used for in vitro experiments. Patient-derived xenografts engineered to express Luciferase (PDX) were used for in vivo studies.\\nWe established the dynamics of NPM1c localization and HOX expression upon intermittent XPO1 inhibition. 12h incubation of NPM1c-GFP cells with seli resulted in NPM1c-GFP nuclear relocalization, but drug washout led to rapid NPM1c-GFP relocation into the cytoplasm. Next, we treated OCI-AML3 cells with seli for 24h only (short treatment, ST) or for 72h (continuous treatment, CT). RNA-seq at 72 hours in cells treated with CT demonstrated stable HOX downregulation, while ST did not result in significant changes in HOX expression. We then compared differentiation in cells treated with 2d/w and 5d/w XPO1 inhibition. 5d/w induced terminal differentiation of OCI-AML3 cells, while 2d/w treatment caused negligible differentiation. To confirm these results, we treated two PDXs with either seli (2 or 5d/w) or elta 5d/w for two weeks. In contrast to seli 2d/w, both 5d/w treatments induced near-complete loss of bone marrow AML engraftment, marked by HOX downregulation and differentiation. Finally, we established the effect of prolonged XPO1 inhibition on survival: mice treated for four consecutive weeks with elta 5d/w experienced significantly prolonged survival compared to vehicle.\\nThis study demonstrates that prolonged XPO1 inhibition is necessary to achieve optimal antileukemic activity and lays the groundwork for the design of new clinical trials with XPO1 inhibitors in NPM1c AML.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major clinical concern of liver transplantation, which accounts for organ rejection and liver dysfunction. The adaptor protein p66Shc acts as a crucial redox enzyme and is implicated in liver I/R. Elevated p66Shc expression is associated with hepatocellular apoptosis in liver I/R, but the molecular mechanisms of p66Shc responsible for its aberrant expression and function remain unknown. In the present study, hepatocyte-specific p66Shc-knockdown mice exhibited clear inhibition in hepatocellular apoptosis and oxidative stress under liver I/R, while hepatocyte-specific p66Shc overexpression mice displayed the deteriorative impairment. Mechanistically, p66Shc-triggered mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in liver I/R by mediating ROS-driven Drp1 activation. Furthermore, a screening for p66Shc-interacting proteins identified ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) as a mediator critical for abnormal p66Shc expression. Specifically, USP15 interacted with the SH2 domain of p66Shc and maintained its stabilization by removing ubiquitin. In vivo, p66Shc knockdown abrogated USP15-driven hepatocellular apoptosis, whereas p66Shc overexpression counteracted the antiapoptotic effect of USP15 silencing in response to liver I/R. There was clinical evidence for the positive association between p66Shc and USP15 in patients undergoing liver transplantation. In summary, p66Shc contributes to mitochondrial fission and apoptosis associated with Drp1 activation, and abnormal p66Shc expression relies on the activity of USP15 deubiquitination under liver I/R. The current study sheds new light on the molecular mechanism of p66Shc, and identifies USP15 as a novel mediator of p66Shc to facilitate better therapeutics against liver I/R.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Gasdermin B (GSDMB) over-expression promotes poor prognosis and aggressive behavior in HER2 breast cancer by increasing resistance to therapy. Decoding the molecular mechanism of GSDMB-mediated drug resistance is crucial to identify novel effective targeted treatments for HER2/GSDMB aggressive tumors.\\nDifferent in vitro approaches (immunoblot, qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, proteomic analysis, immunoprecipitation, and confocal/electron microscopy) were performed in HER2 breast and gastroesophageal carcinoma cell models. Results were then validated using in vivo preclinical animal models and analyzing human breast and gastric cancer samples.\\nGSDMB up-regulation renders HER2 cancer cells more resistant to anti-HER2 agents by promoting protective autophagy. Accordingly, the combination of lapatinib with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine increases the therapeutic response of GSDMB-positive cancers in vitro and in zebrafish and mice tumor xenograft in vivo models. Mechanistically, GSDMB N-terminal domain interacts with the key components of the autophagy machinery LC3B and Rab7, facilitating the Rab7 activation during pro-survival autophagy in response to anti-HER2 therapies. Finally, we validated these results in clinical samples where GSDMB/Rab7/LC3B co-expression associates significantly with relapse in HER2 breast and gastric cancers.\\nOur findings uncover for the first time a functional link between GSDMB over-expression and protective autophagy in response to HER2-targeted therapies. GSDMB behaves like an autophagy adaptor and plays a pivotal role in modulating autophagosome maturation through Rab7 activation. Finally, our results provide a new and accessible therapeutic approach for HER2/GSDMB\\u2009+\\u2009cancers with adverse clinical outcome.\",\n",

Accordingly, the combination of lapatinib with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine increases the therapeutic response of GSDMB-positive cancers in vitro and in zebrafish and mice tumor xenograft in vivo models. Mechanistically, GSDMB N-terminal domain interacts with the key components of the autophagy machinery LC3B and Rab7, facilitating the Rab7 activation during pro-survival autophagy in response to anti-HER2 therapies. Finally, we validated these results in clinical samples where GSDMB/Rab7/LC3B co-expression associates significantly with relapse in HER2 breast and gastric cancers.\",\n",

In this study, we investigated the mechanism of GNT in sepsis.\\nWe observed that GNT enhanced survival and alleviated inflammatory injuries of the lungs, liver, kidneys, and intestines in mice with sepsis. Furthermore, regulatory T cells (Tregs) showed enhanced inhibitory function, and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\\u03b2, TNF-\\u03b1, and IL-2 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 showed decreased and increased peritoneal fluid levels, respectively, after treatment with GNT. GNT showed enhanced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (p-STAT5) in Tregs in vivo and in vitro. The STAT5 inhibitor restrained the increased functional changes of Tregs and reduced inflammatory responses induced by GNT in vitro. Moreover, the STAT5 inhibitor reversed GNT-mediated impacts on survival and inflammation, and the percentage, apoptosis, and phenotypic and functional changes of Tregs in neonatal sepsis.\\nOur study revealed that GNT regulates the function of Tregs via the STAT5 signaling pathway, alleviating inflammatory injuries, and provides novel evidence in the treatment of neonatal sepsis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The tumor microenvironment contains stromal cells, including endothelial cells and fibroblasts, that aid tumor growth and impair immune cell function. Many solid tumors remain difficult to cure because of tumor-promoting stromal cells, but current therapies targeting tumor stromal cells are constrained by modest efficacy and toxicities. TEM8 is a surface antigen selectively upregulated on tumor and tumor stromal cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts that may be targeted with specific natural killer (NK) cell engagement.\\nA Tri-specific Killer Engager (TriKE) against TEM8-'cam1615TEM8'-was generated using a mammalian expression system. Its function on NK cells was assessed by evaluation of degranulation, inflammatory cytokine production, and killing against tumor and stroma cell lines in standard co-culture and spheroid assays. cam1615TEM8-mediated proliferation and STAT5 phosphorylation in NK cells was tested and compared with T cells by flow cytometry. NK cell proliferation, tumor infiltration, and tumor and tumor-endothelium killing by cam1615TEM8 and interleukin-15 (IL-15) were assessed in NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice.\\ncam1615TEM8 selectively stimulates NK cell degranulation and inflammatory cytokine production against TEM8-expressing tumor and stromal cell lines. The increased activation translated to superior NK cell killing of TEM8-expressing tumor spheroids. cam1615TEM8 selectively stimulated NK cell but not T cell proliferation in vitro and enhanced NK cell proliferation, survival, and tumor infiltration in vivo. Finally, cam1615TEM8 stimulated NK cell killing of tumor and tumor endothelial cells in vivo.\\nOur findings indicate that the cam1615TEM8 TriKE is a novel anti-tumor, anti-stroma, and anti-angiogenic cancer therapy for patients with solid tumors. This multifunctional molecule works by selectively targeting and activating NK cells by costimulation with IL-15, and then targeting that activity to TEM8+ tumor cells and TEM8+ tumor stroma.\",\n",

Although there are potent disease-modifying agents for its initial relapsing-remitting phase, immunosuppressive therapies show limited efficacy in secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Although modulation of sphingosine-1 phosphate receptors has proven beneficial during SPMS, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this project, we followed the hypothesis that siponimod, a sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor modulator, exerts protective effects by direct modulation of glia cell function (i.e., either astrocytes, microglia, or oligodendrocytes). To this end, we used the toxin-mediated, nonautoimmune MS animal model of cuprizone (Cup) intoxication. On the histological level, siponimod ameliorated cuprizone-induced oligodendrocyte degeneration, demyelination, and axonal injury. Protective effects were evident as well using GE180 translocator protein 18-kDa (TSPO) imaging with positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging or next generation sequencing (NGS). Siponimod also ameliorated the cuprizone-induced pathologies in \",\n",

Pyroptosis has been suggested to be crucial in the development of UC. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are broadly used for UC therapy, they have rarely been studied in the context of UC pyroptosis. Hair follicle-derived MSCs (HFMSCs) are especially understudied with regard to UC and pyroptosis. In this study, we aimed to discover the effects and potential mechanisms of HFMSCs in UC. We administered HFMSCs to dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) treated mice and found that the HFMSCs significantly inhibited pyroptosis to alleviate DSS-induced UC. A transwell system and GW4869, an exosome inhibitor, were used to prove the paracrine mechanism of HFMSCs. HFMSC supernatant reduced pyroptosis-related protein expression and promoted cell viability, but these effects were attenuated by GW4869, suggesting a role for HFMSC-released exosomes (Exos) in pyroptosis. Next, Exos were extracted and administered \",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In the treatment of malignant tumors, the effectiveness of cisplatin (CP) is limited by its nephrotoxicity, leading to cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (CP-AKI). Polydatin (PD) has been demonstrated to regulate autophagy in tumors, sepsis, and diabetes. We have recently confirmed that PD attenuated CP-AKI by inhibiting ferroptosis, but it is not clear whether PD can regulate autophagy to protect from CP-AKI. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of PD on autophagy in CP-treated HK-2 cells and CP-AKI mouse models, exploring the role of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) upregulated by PD. In this study, the blocking of autophagy flux was observed in both CP-treated HK-2 cells in vitro and CP-AKI mouse models in vivo, whereas this blocking was reversed by PD, which was characterized by the increase of autophagy microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 II expression and autophagolysosome/autophagosome ratio and the decrease of p62 expression. Furthermore, PD also significantly increased the expression of SIRT6 in vivo and in vitro. The protective effect of PD manifested by the stimulating of autophagy flux, with the reducing of inflammatory response and oxidative stress, which included downregulation of tumor necrosis factor-\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Biopiezoelectric materials have good biocompatibility and excellent piezoelectric properties, and they can generate local currents in vivo to restore the physiological electrical microenvironment of the defect and promote bone regeneration. Previous studies of guided bone regeneration membranes have rarely addressed the point of restoring it, so this study prepared a Barium titanate/Polylactic acid (BT/PLA) piezoelectric composite membrane and investigated its bone-formation, with a view to providing an experimental basis for clinical studies of guided bone tissue regeneration membranes.\\nBT/PLA composite membranes with different BT ratio were prepared by solution casting method, and piezoelectric properties were performed after corona polarization treatment. The optimal BT ratio was selected and then subjected to in vitro cytological experiments and in vivo osteogenic studies in rats. The effects on adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of the pre-osteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1) were investigated. The effect of composite membranes on bone repair of cranial defects in rats was investigated after 4 and 12 weeks.\\nThe highest piezoelectric coefficient d33 were obtained when the BT content was 20%, reaching (7.03 \\u00b1 0.26) pC/N. The value could still be maintained at (4.47\\u00b10.17) pC/N after 12 weeks, meeting the piezoelectric constant range of bone. In vitro, the MC3T3-E1 cells showed better adhesion and proliferative activity in the group of polarized 20%BT. The highest alkaline phosphatase (ALP) content was observed in cells of this group. In vivo, it promoted rapid bone regeneration. At 4 weeks postoperatively, new bone formation was evident at the edges of the defect, with extensive marrow cavity formation; after 12 weeks, the defect was essentially completely closed, with density approximating normal bone tissue and significant mineralization.\\nThe BT/PLA piezoelectric composite membrane has good osteogenic properties and provides a new idea for guiding the research of membrane materials for bone tissue regeneration.\",\n",

Recently, we demonstrated that the microbial metabolite Urolithin A (UroA) mitigates colitis through its gut barrier protective and anti-inflammatory activities in an AhR-dependent manner. Here, we explored role of CYP1A1 in UroA-mediated gut barrier and immune functions in regulation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\\nTo determine the role of CYP1A1 in UroA-mediated protectives activities against colitis, we subjected C57BL/6 mice and \\nUroA treatment mitigated DSS-induced acute colitis in the wildtype mice. However, UroA-failed to protect \\nOur results suggest that CYP1A1 expression is essential for UroA-mediated enhanced gut barrier functions and protective activities against colitis. We postulate that CYP1A1 plays critical and yet unknown functions beyond xenobiotic metabolism in the regulation of gut epithelial integrity and immune systems to maintain gut homeostasis in IBD pathogenesis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"For patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), targeted therapy significantly improves the therapeutic effect of NSCLC patients. With the development of molecular targeted therapy, more and more NSCLC-related genes have been found. Thousand and one amino-acid kinase 1 (TAOK1) has been identified as a potential target for drug research in various cancers. The main objective of this study was to explore the expression and function of TAOK1 in NSCLC.\\nWestern blotting was employed to assess TAOK1 expression in NSCLC cell lines. The effects of TAOK1 on biological behaviors, including proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis of NSCLC cells, were assessed. The relationship between TAOK1 and WW and C2 domain containing 1 (WWC1) was assessed by Co-IP assay. The subcutaneous injection of tumor cells in nude mice was used to verify it in vivo.\\nAs expected, TAOK1 was increased in NSCLC cell lines. Following TAOK1 knockdown, NSCLC cells exhibited a significant decrease in the invasion and increased apoptosis in vitro. Instead, the TAOK1 elevation showed the opposite results. The Co-IP assay identified that TAOK1 specifically interacted with WWC1. Knockdown of WWC1 overturned TAOK1 silencing-mediated malignant phenotype of NSCLC cells. Additionally, subcutaneous tumorigenesis assays in nude mice confirmed that TAOK1 knockdown markedly restrained the proliferation capacity of NSCLC cells in vivo.\\nSurprisingly, TAOK1 overexpression in NSCLC promotes tumor cell growth and invasion, which is associated with downregulation of its downstream protein WWC1, and this result might provide a robust research basis to inquire about the precise therapeutic targets for NSCLC.\",\n",

Cell transfection with lentivirus EIF3C short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was performed with Lipofectamine 2000. Cell proliferation was evaluated by Celigo and MTT assays. Caspase-3/7 activity was assessed using caspase-3/7 assay kit for cell apoptosis detection. The apoptosis rate of lung cancer cells was assessed by flow cytometry. A transplanted tumor nude-mouse model was established to clarify the role of EIF3C in lung cancer. The potential mechanism of EIF3C was explored by mRNA microarray analysis. Among the top 30 up- and downregulated mRNAs selected for RT-qPCR, 5 were chosen for western blot analysis.\\nEIF3C was abnormally overexpressed in lung cancer cell lines and tissues. Silencing EIF3C suppressed the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of lung cancer cells. \\nEIF3C overexpression may facilitate the proliferation and hamper the apoptosis of lung cancer cells by regulating the APP/HSPA1A/LMNB1 axis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental movement disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics. In this study, we used a TS rat model induced by 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN) and aimed to investigate the expression change of Syntaxin 1A (STX1A). Rats in the control group received intraperitoneal injection of normal saline, and TS rats were injected with IDPN (150\\u2009mg/kg/day). After 7 days of treatment, the stereotypic behaviors were assessed. Next, rats were sacrificed; brains were removed for RNA extraction and Western blotting analysis and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for immunofluorescence analysis. After 7 days of IDPN administration, stereotypic behaviors were successfully induced. The IDPN group exhibited more counts in biting, putting forepaws around mouth, licking, head twitching, shaking claws, body raising, and episodic utterance. The striatal STX1A mRNA, protein, and STX1A expression in striatal dopaminergic neurons were investigated. As expected, the total STX1A mRNA and protein levels were decreased in the TS model rats. In the striatal dopaminergic neurons, the IDPN group showed a slightly decreased STX1A/TH double positive area, but no statistical significance was found. Additionally, we assessed the expression of some genes closely related to STX1A, such as SNAP25, SY, and gephyrin, and no differences were found between the two groups. Together, reduced STX1A expression is associated with IDPN-induced TS development. Our findings suggested that decreased striatal STX1A expression is associated with the development of TS in the IDPN-induced rat model.\",\n",

Maternally transferred herpes simplex virus (HSV)-specific antibodies reduce the risk of clinically overt nHSV, but this observation has not been translationally applied. Using a neonatal mouse model, we tested the hypothesis that passive transfer of HSV-specific human mAbs can prevent mortality and morbidity associated with nHSV. The mAbs were expressed in vivo via vectored immunoprophylaxis or recombinantly. Through these maternally derived routes or through direct administration to pups, diverse mAbs to HSV glycoprotein D protected against neonatal HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection. Using in vivo bioluminescent imaging, both pre- and post-exposure mAb treatment significantly reduced viral load in mouse pups. Together these studies support the notion that HSV-specific mAb-based therapies could prevent or improve HSV infection outcomes in neonates.\",\n",

Eight dogs with a diagnosis of non-seasonal severe chronic OE were recruited for the study. ZYMOX-P was administered for 2-4 weeks. The Otitis Index Score (OTIS3) and bacteria or yeast colony growth were measured. Also, minimum biofilm (BF) formation inhibition concentration (MBIC) and BF bactericidal concentration (BBC) were measured in vitro. OTIS3 showed a statistically significant reduction after treatment (88.2%, p\\u27e80.001; pre-treatment = 11.0 \\u00b1 0.9; post-treatment = 1.3 \\u00b1 0.4, mean \\u00b1 SEM). The individual OTIS scores, erythema, edema, erosions/ ulcerations, exudate and pruritus showed significant reduction (85.7%, 95.7%, 83.3%, 80.0%, and 89.3%, respectively). Microscopic examination revealed the presence of BF exopolysaccharide in all 8 ear samples when stained with alcian blue. Seven of the 8 dogs (87.5%) showed a reduction in colony growth. ZYMOX-P was effective at 34-fold and 16-fold dilutions on MBIC and BBC, respectively. These findings indicate that ZYMOX-P has efficacy against BF-related infection and is beneficial when used for the management of canine OE.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The favorable properties of cyanines (e.g., near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and emission) have made this class of dyes popular for a wide variety of biomedical applications. However, many cyanines are prone to rapid photobleaching when irradiated with light. In this study, we have exploited this undesirable trait to develop NIR-nanogels for NIR light-mediated cargo delivery. NIR-nanogels feature a photolabile cyanine cross-linker (Cy780-Acryl) that can cleave via dioxetane chemistry when irradiated. This photochemical process results in the formation of two carbonyl fragments and concomitant NIR-nanogel degradation to facilitate cargo release. In contrast to studies where cyanines are utilized as photocages, our approach does not require direct chemical attachment to the cargo, thus expanding our ability to deliver molecules that cannot be covalently modified. We showcase this feature by encapsulating a palette of small-molecule chemotherapeutics that feature a structurally diverse chemical architecture. To demonstrate site-selective release in vivo, we generated a murine model of breast cancer. Relative to nonlight irradiated and drug-free controls, treatment with NIR-nanogels loaded with paclitaxel (a potent cytotoxic agent) and NIR light resulted in significant attenuation of tumor growth. Moreover, we show via histological staining of the vital organs that minimal off-target effects are observed.\",\n",

The discovery of over-expressed components on the tumor cell surface and their specific ligands provide a basis for targeting tumor cells. However, the differences in the expression levels of these receptors on the tumor cell surface limit the clinical application of anti-tumor preparations modified by a single ligand. Meanwhile, toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs leads to poor tolerance to anti-tumor therapy. The discovery of natural active products antagonizing these toxic side effects offers an avenue for relieving cancer patients' pain during the treatment process. Since the advent of nanotechnology, interventions, such as loading appropriate drug combinations into nano-sized carriers and multiple tumor-targeting functional modifications on the carrier surface to enhance the anti-tumor effect and reduce toxic and side effects, have been widely used for treating tumors.\\nNanocarriers containing doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) and salvianolic acid A (Sal A) are spherical with a diameter of about 18\\u00a0nm; the encapsulation efficiency of both DOX and salvianolic acid A is greater than 80%.

The present study aimed to investigate whether MT can improve clinical signs in the EAE model by modulating the KP. C57BL/6 mice were induced with EAE and received different doses of MT.

This study tested the efficacy of BJG398, a small molecule fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (FGFRTK) inhibitor, to rescue the knee joint osteoarthritis phenotype in High Molecular Weight fibroblast growth factor 2 transgenic (HMWTgFGF2) mice. BJG398 was administered in vivo to 8-month-old female HMWTgFGF2 mice for six weeks. Histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry and micro-CT were used to examine the knee joints in BGJ398-treated and control mice. We assessed: Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) expression and FGFR1 activity; Matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and Aggrecanase2 (ADAMTS5) expression; then signaling by SMAD1/5/8-pSMAD6, pERK1/2 and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). Using PrimePCR arrays, we identified a contributing role for major target genes in the TGFB/BMP2 signaling pathway that were regulated by BGJ398. BGJ398 inhibited HMWFGF2/FGF23-induced increase in bone morphogenic protein receptor-1, bone morphogenic protein-2 and 4 and Serine peptidase inhibitor, clade E, member 1. The results from Micro-CT and histology show BGJ398 treatment rescued the OA changes in subchondral bone and knee articular cartilage of HMWTgFGF2 mice. The gene expression and signal transduction results provide convincing evidence that HMWFGF2 generates OA through FGFRTK with characteristic downstream signaling that defines OA, namely: increased FGF23-FGFR1 activity with BMP-BMPR, activation of pSMAD1/5/8-RUNX2 and pERK signaling pathways, then upregulation of MMP13 and ADAMTS5 to degrade matrix. BGJ398 treatment effectively reversed these OA molecular phenotypes, providing further evidence that the OA generated by HMWFGF2 in the transgenic mice is FGFR-mediated and phenocopies the OA found in the Hyp mouse homolog of XLH with a spontaneous mutation in the Phex (phosphate regulating endopeptidase on the X chromosome) gene and human XLH-OA. Overall, the results obtained here explain how the pleotropic effects of FGF2 emanate from the different functions of HMW protein isoforms for cartilage and bone homeostasis, and the pathogenesis of XLH-degenerative osteoarthropathy. BGJ398 inhibits HMWFGF2-induced osteoarthritis via multiple mechanisms. These results provided important scientific evidence for the potential application of BGJ398 as a therapeutic agent for osteoarthritis in XLH.\",\n",

Since chondrocytes and osteoblasts originate from the same progenitor cells, we reasoned that dynamic loading may stimulate a similar response in chondrocytes. A stimulating effect could be beneficial for patients with damaged condylar cartilage or mandibular deficiency.\\nStudies were conducted on growing Sprague-Dawley rats divided into three groups: control, static load, and dynamic load. The dynamic load group received a dynamic load on the lower right molars 5 minutes per day with a 0.3 g acceleration and peak strain of 30 \\u03bc\\u03b5\\u00a0registered by accelerometer and strain gauge. The static load group received an equivalent magnitude of static force (30 \\u03bc\\u03b5). The control group did not receive any treatment. Samples were collected at days 0, 28, and 56 for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis, microcomputed tomography, and histology and fluorescent microscopy analysis.\\nOur experiments showed that dynamic loading had a striking effect on condylar cartilage, increasing the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes, and promoting chondrocyte maturation. This effect was accompanied by increased endochondral bone formation resulting in lengthening of the condylar process.\\nLow-magnitude, high-frequency dynamic loading can have a positive effect on condylar cartilage and endochondral bone formation in vivo. This effect has the potential to be used as a treatment for regenerating condylar cartilage and to enhance the effect of orthopedic appliances on mandibular growth.\",\n",

Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) plays a critical role in I/RI by impeding apoptosis and inflammation. Here, we aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms of ALA after I/RI.\\nThe left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was ligated, and H9c2 cells were exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) to establish an I/RI model. Prior to this, H9c2 cells and rats were treated using an appropriate amount of ALA. The cardiac function, inflammatory factors, and myocardial pathology were assessed in vitro. We detected cell viability, apoptosis, and oxidative stress-related factors in vivo. Moreover, proteins of the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-\\u03baB signaling pathway were detected both in vivo and in vitro.\\nWe observed that ALA increased cell viability in vitro and decreased apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. ALA inhibited reactive oxygen species production, decreased malondialdehyde, and increased superoxide dismutase activity to resist oxidative stress in vitro. ALA also reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\\u03b2, and TNF-\\u03b1) in vivo. ALA also suppressed the levels of the apoptotic protein, Bax, and increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we observed that ALA significantly inhibited the cytoplasmic localization of HMGB1, which might attenuate MI/RI or H/R via HMGB1/TLR4/NF-\\u03baB pathway.\\nALA regulates HMGB1 translocation and attenuates I/R via the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-\\u03baB signaling pathway, thus impeding apoptosis, oxidation, and inflammation, and might be a potential target for myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.\",\n",

Biological functions of linc00174 on cell proliferation and pyroptosis were evaluated by CCK-8, flow cytometry, caspase-1 activity assays, respectively. Luciferase reporter assay was employed to verify the interaction between miR-26a-5p and linc00174/PTEN. Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DR in mice was further constructed to verify the potential role of linc00174 in\\u00a0vivo. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical staining were performed to assess the pathological changes and caspase-1 expression in retinal tissues.\\nUp-regulated linc00174 and PTEN and down-regulated miR-26a-5p were uncovered in hRMECs treated with high glucose (HG). Mechanistically, linc00174 served as a sponge of miR-26a-5p to facilitate PTEN expression. Functionally, knockdown of linc00174 inhibited HG-induced pyroptosis of hRMECs via targeting miR-26a-5p. Moreover, linc00174/miR-26a-5p axis participated in HG-induced pyroptosis via PTEN/Akt signaling cascade. Further, silencing of linc00174 attenuated pyroptosis via regulating miR-26a-5p/PETN axis in DR mice.\\nCollectively, our study reveals that linc10074 deteriorates the pathogenesis of DR via miR-26a-5p/PTEN/Akt signalling cascade, which may shed light on the discovery of potential therapeutic agents for DR treatment.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Among the various methods, Non Thermal Plasma (NTP) has been recently introduced and is being studied to recover the damaged nerve. In the recent years, several studies have suggested that NTP accelerates nerve cell regeneration, but the mechanism remains unknown. This study evaluated the effect of NTP on neuronal proliferation in SH-SY5Y (Human neuroblastoma cells) cells differentiated by retinoic acid (RA) and investigated the mechanism by which NTP promotes cell proliferation. We analyzed the morphology of differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, and performed western blot analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immunofluorescence analysis was performed in an in vivo study by categorizing Wistar A rats into three groups: non-nerve damage (Non-ND), nerve damage (ND), and nerve damage\\u2009+\\u2009NTP treatment (ND\\u2009+\\u2009NTP). The cell morphology analysis revealed that the number of cells increased and axonal elongation progressed after NTP treatment. In addition, western blots indicated that tau expression increased significantly after NTP treatment. The RT-PCR results revealed that the expression of tau, wnt3a, and \\u03b2-catenin increased after NTP treatment. The in vivo immunofluorescence assay showed that NTP increased the markers for tau and S100B while regulating the over-expression of MAP2 and GAP43. NTP treatment accelerated cell proliferation and regeneration of damaged neurons in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. These results establish the fact of NTP as a noninvasive and effective treatment for nerve injury.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Excision tissue biopsy, while central to cancer treatment and precision medicine, presents risks to the patient and does not provide a sufficiently broad and faithful representation of the heterogeneity of solid tumors. Here we introduce e-biopsy-a novel concept for molecular profiling of solid tumors using molecular sampling with electroporation. As e-biopsy provides access to the molecular composition of a solid tumor by permeabilization of the cell membrane, it facilitates tumor diagnostics without tissue resection. Furthermore, thanks to its non tissue destructive characteristics, e-biopsy enables probing the solid tumor multiple times in several distinct locations in the same procedure, thereby enabling the spatial profiling of tumor molecular heterogeneity.We demonstrate e-biopsy in vivo, using the 4T1 breast cancer model in mice to assess its performance, as well as the inferred spatial differential protein expression. In particular, we show that proteomic profiles obtained via e-biopsy in vivo distinguish the tumors from healthy breast tissue and reflect spatial tumor differential protein expression. E-biopsy provides a completely new molecular sampling modality for solid tumors molecular cartography, providing information that potentially enables more rapid and sensitive detection at lesser risk, as well as more precise personalized medicine.\",\n",

Here, we explore the relationship between nucleus accumbens-associated protein-1 (NAC1), a nuclear factor of the BTB (broad-complex, Tramtrack, bric a brac)/POZ (Poxvirus, and Zinc finger) gene family, and the TME.\\nAdoptive cell transfer (ACT) of mouse or human tumor antigen (Ag)-specific CD8\\nTumorous expression of NAC1 negatively impacts the CTL-mediated antitumor immunity via lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA)-mediated suppressive TME. NAC1 positively regulated the expression of LDHA at the transcriptional level, which led to higher accumulation of lactic acid in the TME. This inhibited the cytokine production and induced exhaustion and apoptosis of CTLs, impairing their cell-killing ability. In the immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice, NAC1 depleted melanoma tumors grew significantly slower and had an elevated infiltration of tumor Ag-specific CTLs following ACT, compared with the control groups.\\nTumor expression of NAC1 contributes substantially to immune evasion through its regulatory role in LDHA expression and lactic acid production. Thus, therapeutic targeting of NAC1 warrants further exploration as a potential strategy to reinforce cancer immunotherapy, such as the ACT of CTLs.\",\n",

The present investigation aimed to develop a radiopharmaceutical targeting brain cancer based on natural isovanillin. Different parameters were optimized, resulting in high radiolabeling efficiency (97.3\\u00a0\\u00b1\\u00a01.2%) and good stability (<48\\u00a0h). The tracer was formulated for intranasal delivery in a chitosan nanoparticles system with a mean particle size of 141\\u00a0\\u00b1\\u00a02\\u00a0nm, a polydispersity index of 0.23\\u00a0\\u00b1\\u00a00.02, and a zeta potential of -17.4\\u00a0\\u00b1\\u00a00.3\\u00a0mV to enhance nasal uptake and surmount the blood-brain barrier. The system was characterized and assessed in-vitro for suitability and specificity and evaluated in-vivo in normal and tumorized mice. The biodistribution profile in brain tumor showed 20.5\\u00a0\\u00b1\\u00a00.4 %ID/g localization and cancer cell targeting within 60\\u00a0min. Improvement in brain tumor uptake resulted from both the nanoformulation and nasal administration of iodoisovanillin.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is one of the best studied cellular uptake pathways and its contributions to nutrient uptake, receptor signaling, and maintenance of the lipid membrane homeostasis have been already elucidated. Today, we still have a lack of understanding how the different components of this pathway cooperate dynamically in vivo. Therefore, we generated a reporter mouse model for CME by fusing eGFP endogenously in frame to clathrin light chain a (Clta) to track endocytosis in living mice. The fusion protein is expressed in all tissues, but in a cell specific manner, and can be visualized using fluorescence microscopy. Recruitment to nanobeads recorded by TIRF microscopy validated the functionality of the Clta-eGFP reporter. With this reporter model we were able to track the dynamics of Alexa594-BSA uptake in kidneys of anesthetized mice using intravital 2-photon microscopy. This reporter mouse model is not only a suitable and powerful tool to track CME in vivo in genetic or disease mouse models it can also help to shed light into the differential roles of the two clathrin light chain isoforms in health and disease.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Fungi of the genus Trichoderma have been marketed for the management of diseases of crops. However, some Trichoderma species may produce toxic secondary metabolites and it should receive due attention to ensure human safety. In this study, we investigated the in vitro antagonistic potential of T. asperellum AU131 and T. longibrachiatum AU158 as microbial biocontrol agents (MBCAs) against Fusarium xylarioides and the associated antagonistic mechanism with bioactive substances. Swiss albino mice were used to evaluate the in vivo toxicity and pathogenicity of T. asperellum AU131 and T. longibrachiatum AU158 methanolic extracts and spore suspensions, respectively, in a preliminary safety assessment for use as biofungicides. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to profile volatile organic metabolites (VOCs) present in the methanolic extracts. The agar diffusion assay of the methanolic extracts from both T. asperellum AU131 and T. longibrachiatum AU158 were effective at a concentration of 200 \\u03bcg/mL (1\\u00d7107 spores/mL), causing 62.5%, and 74.3% inhibition, respectively. A GC-MS analysis of methanolic extracts from both bioagents identified 23 VOCs which classified as alcohols, acids, sesquiterpenes, ketones and aromatic compounds. The oral administration of methanolic extracts and spore suspensions of each Trichoderma species to female Swiss albino mice over 14 days did not show any significant signs of toxicity, mortality or changes to body weight. It can be concluded that the tested spore suspensions and methanolic extracts were not pathogenic or toxic, respectively, when administered to Swiss albino mice at various doses.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The intrinsic pain inhibitory mechanisms can be activated by fear, anxiety, and stress. Stressful experiences produce analgesia, referred to as stress-induced analgesia (SIA). Major components of the limbic system, including the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus, are involved in the SIA. In this study, we tried to understand the role of dopamine receptors in the cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1) of the hippocampus in the forced swim stress (FSS)-induced analgesia. Stereotaxic surgery was unilaterally performed on 129 adult male Wistar rats weighing 220-280 g. SCH23390 (0.25, 1, and 4 \\u03bcg/0.5 \\u03bcl saline) or sulpiride (0.25, 1, and 4 \\u03bcg/0.5 \\u03bcl DMSO), as D1- and D2-like dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively, were microinjected into the CA1 area, 5 min before exposure to FSS for a 6-min period. The vehicle groups received saline or DMSO instead of SCH23390 or sulpiride, respectively. The formalin test was done using formalin injection (50 \\u03bcl; 2.5%) into the plantar surface of the rat's hind paw immediately after exposure to FSS. The results demonstrated that FSS produces analgesia during the early and late phases of the formalin test. However, intra-CA1 microinjection of SCH23390 or sulpiride attenuated the FSS-induced analgesia in both phases of the formalin test. This study provides new insight into the role of D1- and D2-like dopamine receptors in the CA1 area in the FSS-induced analgesia during persistent inflammatory pain.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Compared to intravenous administration, intratumoral drug administration enables the direct delivery of drugs to tumors and mitigates the systemic absorption of drugs and associated drug-induced side effects. However, intratumoral drug administration presents several challenges. The high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) of the tumor prevents the retention of drugs within the tumor; thus, significant amounts of the drugs are absorbed systemically through the bloodstream or delivered to non-target sites. To solve this problem, in this study, a drug-enclosed needle-type starch implant was developed that can overcome IFP and remain in the tumor.\\nInjectable needle-type starch implants (NS implants) were prepared by starch gelatinization and drying. The structure, cytotoxicity, and anticancer effects of the NS implants were evaluated. Biodistribution of NS implants was evaluated in pork (in vitro), dissected liver (ex vivo), and 4T1 tumors in mice (in vivo) using a fluorescence imaging device.\\nThe prepared NS implants exhibited a hydrogel structure after water absorption. NS implants showed effective cytotoxicity and anticancer effects by photothermal therapy (PTT). The NS implant itself has sufficient strength and can be easily injected into a desired area. In vivo, the NS implant continuously delivered drugs to the tumor more effectively and uniformly than conventional hydrogels and solutions.\\nThis study demonstrated the advantages of needle-type implants. An injectable NS implant can be a new formulation that can effectively deliver drugs and exhibit anticancer effects.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The purpose of this study was to discuss the effect of voluntary wheel running on striatal dopamine levels and anxiety-like behavior in rats with global cerebral ischemia. The male Sprague-Dawley rats were signed on in this study and randomly divided into following 4 groups: Control group (C group), Sham group (S group), ischemia group (I group), and 3 weeks physical exercise before ischemia group (3RI group). The rats in the 3RI group were placed in a voluntary running wheel for three weeks to exercise. Then, the rats in I and 3RI groups received bilateral carotid artery ligation (2-VO) operation. The C and S group did not perform voluntary running exercise and the bilateral common carotid arteries of S group were exposed without ligation. In vivo microdialysis was used in conjunction with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrochemical detection to ascertain the level of dopamine in the striatum. Elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field (OF) were used to test anxiety status at 24 hours and 7days after 2-VO cerebral ischemia. Meanwhile, gait and motor coordination evaluations were carried out to eliminate the influence of non-specific motor problems. The results indicated that cerebral ischemia instigate the increase of striatal dopamine in I group rats during acute cerebral ischemia. A 3-week voluntary wheel running significantly enhances the striatal dopamine before ischemia and obstructs a further increase of dopamine during acute cerebral ischemia in 3RI group rats. At 24 hours after ischemia, striatal dopamine returned to pre-ischemic levels in 3RI group. Striatal dopamine in I group were less than pre-ischemic levels at 7 days. Behavioral data indicated that 3-week voluntary wheel running promoted recovery of anxiety-like behavior and gait were not affected by 2-VO cerebral ischemia at 24 hours post-ischemia rats. Therefore, it can be concluded that 3-week physical exercise significantly increased the striatal dopamine and improved anxiety-like behavior by inhibiting the increase of dopamine during acute cerebral ischemia and suppressing the decrease of dopamine after 24 hours and 7 days cerebral ischemia.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Frequent outbreaks of the highly pathogenic influenza A virus (AIV) infection, together with the lack of broad-spectrum influenza vaccines, call for the development of broad-spectrum prophylactic agents. Previously, 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified bovine \\u03b2-lactoglobulin (3HP-\\u03b2-LG) was proven to be effective against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and it has also been used in the clinical control of cervical human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. Here, we show its efficacy in potently inhibiting infection by divergent influenza A and B viruses. Mechanistic studies suggest that 3HP-\\u03b2-LG binds, possibly through its negatively charged residues, to the receptor-binding domain in the hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) subunit in the HA of the influenza virus, thus inhibiting the attachment of the HA to sialic acid on host cells. The intranasal administration of 3HP-\\u03b2-LG led to the protection of mice against challenges by influenza A(H1N1)/PR8, A(H3N2), and A(H7N9) viruses. Furthermore, 3HP-\\u03b2-LG is highly stable when stored at 50 \\u00b0C for 30 days and it shows excellent safety in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings suggest that 3HP-\\u03b2-LG could be successfully repurposed as an intranasal prophylactic agent to prevent influenza virus infections during influenza outbreaks.\",\n",

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections are acquired asymptomatically, and primary infections are difficult to capture. The gap in our knowledge of the early events of HCMV colonization and spread limits rational design of HCMV antivirals and vaccines. Studies of natural infection with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) have demonstrated the olfactory epithelium as the site of natural colonization. Systemic spread from the olfactory epithelium is facilitated by infected dendritic cells (DC); tracking dissemination uncovered previously unappreciated DC trafficking pathways. The olfactory epithelium also provides a unique niche that supports efficient MCMV superinfection and virus recombination. In this review, we summarize recent advances to our understanding of MCMV infection and spread and the tissue-specific mechanisms utilized by MCMV to modulate DC trafficking. As these mechanisms are likely conserved with HCMV, they may inform new approaches for preventing HCMV infections in humans.\",\n",

CCN1 is a secreted matricellular protein that drives various cellular functions, including proliferation, migration, and differentiation. However, its role in mediating FFA-induced pro-inflammatory cell death and its underlying molecular mechanisms have not been characterized. In this study, we demonstrated that CCN1 was upregulated in the livers of obese mice. The increase in FFA-induced CCN1 was evaluated in vitro by treating hepatocytes with a combination of oleic acid and palmitic acid (2:1). Gene silencing using specific small interfering RNAs (siRNA) revealed that CCN1 participated in FFA-induced intracellular lipid accumulation, caspase-1 activation, and hepatocyte pyroptosis.

The RNA-binding protein NOVA1 is expressed in human and rodent pancreatic \\u03b2-cells. Previous in vitro studies indicated that NOVA1 is necessary for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and its deficiency-enhanced cytokine-induced apoptosis. Moreover, Bim, a proapoptotic protein, is differentially spliced and potentiates apoptosis in NOVA1-deficient \\u03b2-cells in culture. We generated two novel mouse models by Cre-Lox technology lacking Nova1 (\\u03b2Nova1\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related liver fibrosis results in the encapsulation of injured liver parenchyma by a collagenous scar mainly imputable to hepatic stellate cells' activation. Approved pharmacological treatments against NAFLD-related fibrosis are still lacking, but natural compounds such as hydroxytyrosol (HXT) and vitamin E (VitE), are emerging as promising therapeutic opportunities. In this study, the potential anti-fibrotic effect of HXT + VitE combination therapy was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In particular, tumor growth factor (TGF)-\\u03b2-activated LX-2 cells as an in vitro model, and carbon tetrachloride plus a Western diet as a mice model were employed. The effect of HXT + VitE on fibrosis was also investigated in children with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Our results demonstrated that HXT + VitE caused a reduction of proliferation, migration, contractility, and expression of pro-fibrogenic genes in TGF-\\u03b2-activated LX-2 cells. HXT + VitE treatment also antagonized TGF-\\u03b2-dependent upregulation of pro-oxidant NOX2 by interfering with nuclear translocation/activation of SMAD2/3 transcription factors. The mouse model of NAFLD-related fibrosis treated with HXT + VitE showed a marked reduction of fibrosis pattern by histology and gene expression. Accordingly, in children with NAFLD, HXT + VitE treatment caused a decrease of circulating levels of PIIINP and NOX2 that was supported over time. Our study suggests that HXT + VitE supplementation may improve NAFLD-related fibrosis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Naringin is a dietary flavonoid glycoside with broad bioactivities, and it has been found to undergo extensive microbial metabolism in human gut. Microbial metabolites are believed to play an important role in the overall bioactivity of naringin. However, knowledge is scarce about its microbial metabolism in laboratory rats, which are the most commonly used animal model for naringin-related biomedical studies. Herein, we profiled the microbial metabolism of naringin in rat by an in vitro anaerobic fermentation combined with LC-MS/MS methods. A total of 35 microbial metabolites were identified, and corresponding metabolic pathways were proposed. Naringin and its metabolites were further quantified in fermentation samples. Rhoifolin, neoeriocitrin, neohesperidin, naringenin, methylated naringin, and hydroxylated naringin were detected as the primary microbial metabolites. Moreover, antioxidant capacity assays suggested that fermentation-associated microbial metabolites exhibited higher antioxidant activity than original naringin. Obtained results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the microbial metabolism and antioxidant capacity of naringin.\",\n",

Senescence in astrocytes has been discovered as a crucial contributor to several age-related neurological diseases. Here, we aim to observe if astrocytes demonstrate senescence in the process of brain aging, and whether they bring adverse factors, especially harm to neuronal cells. (2) Methods: In vivo, mice were housed for four, 18, and 26 months. An in vitro cell model of aged astrocytes was constructed by serial passaging until passage 20-25, and those within 1-5 were invoked as young astrocytes. Meanwhile, an oxidative induced astrocyte senescence model was constructed by H\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Glucocorticoid-induced osteogenic dysfunction is the main pathologyical mechanism underlying the development of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Glucocorticoids promote adipogenic differentiation and osteoblast apoptosis through various pathways. Various ongoing studies are exploring the potential of natural products in preventing glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Preclinical studies have consistently shown the bone protective effects of tocotrienol through its antioxidant and anabolic effects. This review aims to summarise the potential mechanisms of tocotrienol in preventing glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis based on existing in vivo and in vitro evidence. The current literature showed that tocotrienol prevents oxidative damage on osteoblasts exposed to high levels of glucocorticoids. Tocotrienol reduces lipid peroxidation and increases oxidative stress enzyme activities. The reduction in oxidative stress protects the osteoblasts and preserves the bone microstructure and biomechanical strength of glucocorticoid-treated animals. In other animal models, tocotrienol has been shown to activate the Wnt/\\u03b2-catenin pathway and lower the RANKL/OPG ratio, which are the targets of glucocorticoids. In conclusion, tocotrienol enhances osteogenic differentiation and bone formation in glucocorticoid-treated osteoblasts while improving structural integrity in glucocorticoid-treated rats. This is achieved by preventing oxidative stress and osteoblast apoptosis. However, these preclinical results should be validated in a randomised controlled trial.\",\n",

In this study, Cd-free QD nanoprobes for bioimaging were fabricated by densely embedding multiple indium phosphide/zinc sulfide (InP/ZnS) QDs onto silica templates and coating them with a silica shell.

      "    \"abstract\": \"As energy metabolism regulation factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) is thought to be a potential target for the treatment of depression. The present study was performed to evaluate the effects of activating PPAR\\u03b2/\\u03b4, the most highly expressed subtype in the brain, in depressive in vivo and in vitro models. We observed that PPAR\\u03b2/\\u03b4 agonist GW0742 significantly alleviated depressive behaviors in mice and promoted the formation of autophagosomes around the damaged mitochondria in hippocampal astrocytes. Our in vitro experiments showed that GW0742 could reduce mitochondrial oxidative stress, and thereby attenuate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis pathway via inhibiting IRE1\\u03b1 phosphorylation, subsequently protect against astrocytic apoptosis and loss. Furthermore, we found that PPAR\\u03b2/\\u03b4 agonist induces astrocytic mitophagy companied with the upregulated UCP2 expressions. Knocking down UCP2 in astrocytes could block the anti-apoptosis and pro-mitophagy effects of GW0742. In conclusion, our findings reveal PPAR\\u03b2/\\u03b4 activation protects against ER stress-induced astrocytic apoptosis via enhancing UCP2-mediated mitophagy, which contribute to the anti-depressive action. The present study provides a new insight for depression therapy.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterized by impaired blood flow to the lower extremities, resulting in ischemic limb injuries. Individuals with diabetes and PAD typically have more severe ischemic limb injuries and limb amputations, but the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Previously, we identified BAG3 as a gene within a mouse genetic locus termed limb salvage QTL1 on mouse chromosome 7 that determined the extent of limb necrosis following ischemic injury in C57Bl/6 mice. Whether BAG3 deficiency plays a role in the severe ischemic injury observed in diabetic PAD is not known. In vitro, we found simulated ischemia enhanced BAG3 expression in primary human skeletal muscle cells, whereas BAG3 knockdown increased necroptosis markers and decreased cell viability. In vivo, ischemic skeletal muscles from hind limbs of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice showed poor BAG3 expression compared to normal chow diet (NCD)-fed mice, and this was associated with increased limb amputations. BAG3 overexpression in ischemic skeletal muscles from hind limbs of HFD mice rescued limb amputation and improved autophagy, necroptosis, skeletal muscle function and regeneration. Therefore, BAG3 deficiency in ischemic skeletal muscles contributes to the severity of ischemic limb injury in diabetic PAD, likely through autophagy and necroptosis pathways.\",\n",

Thus, the present study was conducted to analyze in vivo responses to both xenogeneic and synthetic bone substitute granules. A standardized calvaria implantation model in Wistar rats, in combination with established scoring, histological, histopathological, and histomorphometrical methods, was conducted to analyze the influence of both biomaterials on bone regeneration and the immune response.

      "    \"abstract\": \"New blood vessel formation is a key component of the cardiac repair process after myocardial infarction (MI). Hypoxia following MI is a major driver of angiogenesis in the myocardium. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1\\u03b1 (HIF1\\u03b1) is the key regulator of proangiogenic signaling. The present study found that stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) significantly contributed to the induction of angiogenesis in the hypoxic myocardium independently of HIF1\\u03b1 expression. The pharmacological inhibition of SCD activity in HL-1 cardiomyocytes and SCD knockout in an animal model disturbed the expression and secretion of proangiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor-A, proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1\\u03b2, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor \\u03b1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and Rantes), metalloproteinase-9, and platelet-derived growth factor in ischemic cardiomyocytes. These disturbances affected the proangiogenic potential of ischemic cardiomyocytes after SCD depletion. Together with the most abundant SCD1 isoform, the heart-specific SCD4 isoform emerged as an important regulator of new blood vessel formation in the murine post-MI myocardium. We also provide evidence that SCD shapes energy metabolism of the ischemic heart by maintaining the shift from fatty acids to glucose as the substrate that is used for adenosine triphosphate production. Furthermore, we propose that the regulation of the proangiogenic properties of hypoxic cardiomyocytes by key modulators of metabolic signaling such as adenosine monophosphate kinase, protein kinase B (AKT), and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-\\u03b3 coactivator 1\\u03b1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \\u03b1 depends on SCD to some extent. Thus, our results reveal a novel mechanism that links SCD to cardiac repair processes after MI.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Some scholars have suggested that the clinical application of exosomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs-exo) might represent a novel strategy to improve diabetic wound healing. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of hucMSCs-exo on wound healing remain poorly understood. This study aimed to identify the mechanism of hucMSCs-exo in treating diabetic wounds. HucMSCs-exo were isolated from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) and subcutaneously injected into full-thickness wounds in diabetic rats. Wound healing closure rates and histological analysis were performed. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1 (TNF-\\u03b1), macrophage mannose receptor (MMR/CD206), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected by immunohistochemistry. The degree of collagen deposition was examined using Masson's trichrome staining. Gross evaluation of wound healing was carried out from day 0 to 14 post-surgery, and the wound site was harvested for histology on days 3, 7, and 14 post-wounding. HucMSCs-exo transplantation increased diabetic wound healing. In vitro, hucMSCs-exo promoted the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and NIH-3T3 cells. In vivo, hucMSCs-exo reduced wound area and inflammatory infiltration and increased collagen fibers. In addition, wound tissues in the hucMSCs-exo group had higher CD206, CD31, and VEGF expressions and lower TNF-\\u03b1 levels than those in the control group on day 14. Our results demonstrated that hucMSCs-exo facilitated diabetic wound repair by inducing anti-inflammatory macrophages and promoting angiogenesis and collagen deposition.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"We previously found that cordycepin inhibits the growth and metastasis formation of MDA-MB-231 cells through the Hedgehog pathway but has not validated this in vivo. In this study, we confirmed cordycepin's anti-triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) effect in nude mice and documented its mechanism. We found that cordycepin reduced the volume and weight of MDA-MB-231 xenografts and affected the expression of proliferation-, apoptosis-, epithelial-mesenchymal transition-, and matrix metalloproteinase-related proteins without side effects. RNA sequencing screening, pathway enrichment, and the protein network interaction analysis revealed enriched pathways and targets mainly concentrated on the Hedgehog pathway and its core components of SHH and GLI2. This indicates that the Hedgehog pathway plays a central role in the cordycepin-mediated regulation of growth and metastasis formation in TNBC. The database analysis of the Hedgehog pathway markers (SHH, PTCH1, SMO, GLI1, and GLI2) revealed that the Hedgehog pathway is activated in breast cancer tissues, and its high expression is not conducive to a patient's survival. Finally, we verified that cordycepin effectively inhibited the Hedgehog pathway in TNBC through Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. This study found that cordycepin could regulate the growth and metastasis formation of TNBC through the Hedgehog pathway in vivo, which provides new insights for targeting and treating breast cancer.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Tumor cells are well adapted to grow in conditions of variable oxygen supply and hypoxia by switching between different metabolic pathways. However, the regulatory effect of oxygen on metabolism and its contribution to the metabolic heterogeneity of tumors have not been fully explored. In this study, we develop a methodology for the simultaneous analysis of cellular metabolic status, using the fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) of metabolic cofactor NAD(P)H, and oxygen level, using the phosphorescence lifetime imaging (PLIM) of a new polymeric Ir(III)-based sensor (PIr3) in tumors in vivo. The sensor, derived from a polynorbornene and cyclometalated iridium(III) complex, exhibits the oxygen-dependent quenching of phosphorescence with a 40% longer lifetime in degassed compared to aerated solutions. In vitro, hypoxia resulted in a correlative increase in PIr3 phosphorescence lifetime and free (glycolytic) NAD(P)H fraction in cells. In vivo, mouse tumors demonstrated a high degree of cellular-level heterogeneity of both metabolic and oxygen states, and a lower dependence of metabolism on oxygen than cells in vitro. The small tumors were hypoxic, while the advanced tumors contained areas of normoxia and hypoxia, which was consistent with the pimonidazole assay and angiographic imaging. Dual FLIM/PLIM metabolic/oxygen imaging will be valuable in preclinical investigations into the effects of hypoxia on metabolic aspects of tumor progression and treatment response.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic inflammation is the main factor leading to intestinal fibrosis, resulting in recurrent stenosis, especially in CD patients. Currently, the underlying molecular mechanisms of fibrosis are still unclear. ZNF281 is a zinc-finger transcriptional regulator that has been characterized as an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducing transcription factor, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of pluripotency, stemness, and cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate in vivo and in vitro the role of ZNF281 in intestinal fibrogenesis. Intestinal fibrosis was studied in vivo in C57BL/6J mice with chronic colitis induced by two or three cycles of administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The contribution of ZNF281 to gut fibrosis was studied in vitro in the human colon fibroblast cell line CCD-18Co, activated by the pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF\\u03b21. ZNF281 was downregulated by siRNA transfection, and RNA-sequencing was performed to identify genes regulated by TGF\\u03b21 in activated colon fibroblasts via ZNF281. Results showed a marked increase of ZNF281 in in vivo murine fibrotic colon as well as in in vitro human colon fibroblasts activated by TGF\\u03b21. Moreover, abrogation of ZNF281 in TGF\\u03b21-treated fibroblasts affected the expression of genes belonging to specific pathways linked to fibroblast activation and differentiation into myofibroblasts. We demonstrated that ZNF281 is a key regulator of colon fibroblast activation and myofibroblast differentiation upon fibrotic stimuli by transcriptionally controlling extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, remodeling, and cell contraction, highlighting a new role in the onset and progression of gut fibrosis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Over the past decade, we witnessed a promising application of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) in cancer therapy. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an exhaustive state of the art of CAP employed for the treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC), a tumor whose late diagnosis, local recurrence, distant metastases, and treatment failure are the main causes of patients' death. Specifically, the characteristics and settings of the CAP devices and the in vitro and in vivo treatment protocols were summarized to meet the urgent need for standardization. Its molecular mechanisms of action, as well as the successes and pitfalls of current CAP applications in HNC, were discussed. Finally, the interesting emerging preclinical hypotheses that warrant further clinical investigation have risen. A total of 24 studies were included. Most studies used a plasma jet device (54.2%). Argon resulted as the mostly employed working gas (33.32%). Direct and indirect plasma application was reported in 87.5% and 20.8% of studies, respectively. In vitro investigations were 79.17%, most of them concerned with direct treatment (78.94%). Only eight (33.32%) in vivo studies were found; three were conducted in mice, and five on human beings. CAP showed pro-apoptotic effects more efficiently in tumor cells than in normal cells by altering redox balance in a way that oxidative distress leads to cell death. In preclinical studies, it exhibited efficacy and tolerability. Results from this systematic review pointed out the current limitations of translational application of CAP in the urge of standardization of the current protocols while highlighting promising effects as supporting treatment in HNC.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The interest in stem cell research continuously increased over the last decades, becoming one of the most important trends in the 21st century medicine. Stem cell-based therapies have a potential to become a solution for a range of currently untreatable diseases, such as spinal cord injuries, type I diabetes, Parkinson's disease, heart disease, stroke, and osteoarthritis. Hence, this study, based on canine material, aims to investigate the molecular basis of adipose-derived stem cell (ASC) differentiation into chondrocytes, to serve as a transcriptomic reference for further research aiming to introduce ASC into treatment of bone and cartilage related diseases, such as osteoarthritis in veterinary medicine. Adipose tissue samples were harvested from a canine specimen subjected to a routine ovariohysterecromy procedure at an associated veterinary clinic. The material was treated for ASC isolation and chondrogenic differentiation. RNA samples were isolated at day 1 of culture, day 30 of culture in unsupplemented culture media, and day 30 of culture in chondrogenic differentiation media. The resulting RNA was analyzed using RNAseq assays, with the results validated by RT-qPCR. Between differentiated chondrocytes, early and late cultures, most up- and down-regulated genes in each comparison were selected for further analysis., there are several genes (e.g., \",\n",

Indeed, gut microbial dysbiosis has been identified in an increasing number of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Accordingly, microbial alterations have been reported also in Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting possible pathogenetic mechanisms contributing to the development of specific AD hallmarks and exacerbating metabolic alterations and neuroinflammation. The identification of these mechanisms is crucial to develop novel, targeted therapies and identify potential biomarkers for diagnostic purposes. Thus, the possibility to have AD in vivo models to study this microbial ecosystem represents a great opportunity for translational applications. Here, we characterized both gut microbiome and mycobiome of 3xTg-AD mice, one of the most widely used AD models, to identify specific microbial alterations with respect to the wild-type counterpart. Interestingly, we found a significant reduction of the \",\n",

The aim of this study was to further characterize the clinical and clinicopathological features of and to identify the causative genetic variant for a dyserythropoietic anemia and myopathy syndrome (DAMS) in English springer spaniel dogs (ESSPs). Twenty-six ESSPs, including five dogs with DAMS and two puppies that died perinatally, were studied. Progressive weakness, muscle atrophy-particularly of the temporal and pelvic muscles-trismus, dysphagia, and regurgitation due to megaesophagus were observed at all ages. Affected dogs had a non-regenerative, microcytic hypochromic anemia with metarubricytosis, target cells, and acanthocytes. Marked erythroid hyperplasia and dyserythropoiesis with non-orderly maturation of erythrocytes and inappropriate microcytic metarubricytosis were present. Muscle biopsies showed centralized nuclei, central pallor, lipocyte infiltrates, and fibrosis, which was consistent with centronuclear myopathy. The genome sequencing of two affected dogs was compared to 782 genomes of different canine breeds. A homozygous frameshift single-base deletion in \",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Detecting residual nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC) can be difficult because of the coexistence of occult tumours and post-chemoradiation changes, which poses a challenge for both radiologists and surgeons using current imaging methods. Currently, molecular imaging that precisely targets and visualises particular biomarkers in tumours may exceed the specificity and sensitivity of traditional imaging techniques, providing the potential to distinguish tumours from non-neoplastic lesions. Here, we synthesised a HER2/SR-BI-targeted tracer to efficiently position NPC and guide surgery in living mice. This bispecific tracer contained the following two parts: IRDye 800 CW, as an imaging reagent for both optical and optoacoustic imaging, and a fusion peptide (FY-35), as the targeting reagent. Both in vitro and in vivo tests demonstrated that the tracer had higher accumulation and longer retention (up to 48 h) in tumours than a single-targeted probe, and realised sensitive detection of tumours with a minimum size of 3.9 mm. By visualising the vascular network via a customised handheld optoacoustic scan, our intraoperative fluorescence molecular imaging system provides accurate guidance for intraoperative tumour resection. Integrating the advantages of both optical and optoacoustic scanning in an intraoperative image-guided system, this method holds promise for depicting rNPC and guiding salvage surgery.\",\n",

KcapTR488 contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) conjugated with Texas Red, a caspase-cleavable sequence (DEVD), and a C-terminus conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488). The synthesis and preliminary evaluation in cellulo of KcapTR488 for monitoring cell death by fluorescence imaging has been previously reported, but its utility in vivo has yet to be tested or validated. Herein, in vitro solution experiments verified the intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the two fluorophores and enabled a quantitative analysis of enzyme rates and selectivity. The sensor delivery kinetics in live rat models were quantified by ex vivo fluorescence microscopy. Studies in healthy control retinas demonstrated that KcapTR488 concentrated in the nucleus of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), with a strong colocalization of red and green fluorescence signals producing robust FRET signals, indicating an intact reporter. By contrast, using an acute but mild NMDA-induced retinal injury model, dual-color confocal ex vivo microscopy of cleaved KcapTR488 identified sensor activation as early as 2 h after injection. Quantitative changes in fluorescence colocalization were superior to changes in FRET for monitoring injury progression. Longitudinal monitoring revealed that the NLS-Texas Red fragment of the cleaved sensor moved out of the cell body, down the axon, and exited the retina, consistent with anterograde axonal transport. Thus, KcapTR488 may be a powerful tool to study RGC death pathways in live preclinical models of glaucoma.\",\n",

This study investigates adaptive and pathological alterations in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue following cigarette smoke exposure using in vivo and in vitro models. Mice were exposed to cigarette smoke or air for 72 days and the pre-adipose cell line 3T3-L1 was utilized as an in vitro model. Cigarette smoke exposure decreased body weight, and the proportional loss in fat mass was more pronounced than the lean mass loss. Cigarette smoke exposure reduced adipocyte size and increased adipocyte numbers. Adipose macrophage numbers and associated cytokine levels, including interleukin-1\\u03b2, interleukine-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\\u03b1 were elevated in smoke-exposed mice. Muscle strength and protein synthesis signaling were decreased after smoke exposure; however, muscle mass was not changed. In vitro studies demonstrated that lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation were upregulated in cigarette smoke-exposed pre-adipocytes. In conclusion, cigarette smoke exposure induces a loss of whole-body fat mass and adipose atrophy, which is likely due to enhanced lipolysis.\",\n",

However, only about 20% of the patients display a long-lasting objective tumor response. The modulation of cancer cell immunogenicity via a treatment-induced immunogenic cell death is proposed to potentially be able to improve the rate of patients who respond to immune checkpoint blocking immunotherapies. (2) Methods: Using human HNSCC cell line models and a mouse oral cancer syngeneic model, we have analyzed the ability of the EXTREME regimen (combination therapy using the anti-EGFR cetuximab antibody and platinum-based chemotherapy) to modify the immunogenicity of HNSCC cells. (3) Results: We showed that the combination of cetuximab and cisplatin reduces cell growth through both cell cycle inhibition and the induction of apoptotic cell death independently of p53. In addition, different components of the EXTREME regimen were found to induce, to a variable extent, and in a cell-dependent manner, the emission of mediators of immunogenic cell death, including calreticulin, HMGB1, and type I Interferon-responsive chemokines. Interestingly, cetuximab alone or combined with the IC\",\n",

Finding strategies for bone regeneration such as combining resorbable minerals with organic polymers would contribute to solving the bone volume roadblock. Here, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, chitosan and hyaluronic acid were used to functionalize a bone-side collagen membrane. Despite an increase in the release of inflammatory mediators by human circulating monocytes, the in vivo implantation of the functionalized membrane allowed the repair of a critical-sized defect in a calvaria rat model with de novo bone exhibiting physiological matrix composition and structural organization. Microtomography, histological and Raman analysis combined with nanoindentation testing revealed an increase in bone volume in the presence of the functionalized membrane and the formation of woven bone after eight weeks of implantation; these data showed the potential of dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, chitosan and hyaluronic acid to induce an efficient repair of critical-sized bone defects and establish the importance of thorough multi-scale characterization in assessing biomaterial outcomes in animal models.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"(1) Background: The lack of specific targets has slowed the progress of CAR-T in treating solid tumors. Recent studies have revealed that EDB-FN (fibronectin extra domain B) may be an effective target for CAR-T treatment of solid tumors; EDB-FN is expressed in tumor and embryonic tissues, and antibody-cytokine fusion proteins targeting EDB-FN have been developed. However, the therapeutic effects of BBz CAR-engineered T-cells targeting EDB-FN in solid tumors have not been evaluated. (2) Results: In this study, we constructed a BBz CAR construct targeting EDB-FN, and the CAR molecule was expressed on the surface of T-cells by lentiviral transduction. In vitro, CAR-T-cells can be activated to express perforin and granzyme and lyse EDB-positive cells (U-87 MG cells, A549 cells, and HUVECs) and have no toxicity to EDB-negative cells (MCF-7). Compared to T-cells, CAR-T-cells can release cytokines after coculture with EDB-positive cell lines. In vivo, CAR-T-cells inhibited the progression of U-87 MG subcutaneous tumors and significantly reduced the blood vessel density in tumor tissue compared to T-cells, without obvious toxicity to mouse tissues and organs. Furthermore, CAR-T-cells overexpressing BiTE targeting EDB-FN can significantly improve their antitumor activity in vitro. (3) Conclusions: These results demonstrate that CAR-T-cells have specific antitumor and angiogenic activities in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that EDB-FN may be a potential solid tumor target for CAR-T therapy.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"MiR-22 is mostly considered as a hepatic tumor-suppressor microRNA based on in vitro analyses. Yet, whether miR-22 exerts a tumor-suppressive function in the liver has not been investigated in vivo. Herein, in silico analyses of miR-22 expression were performed in hepatocellular carcinomas from human patient cohorts and different mouse models. Diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinomas were then investigated in lean and diet-induced obese miR-22-deficient mice. The proteome of liver tissues from miR-22-deficient mice prior to hepatocellular carcinoma development was further analyzed to uncover miR-22 regulated factors that impact hepatocarcinogenesis with miR-22 deficiency. MiR-22 downregulation was consistently observed in hepatocellular carcinomas from all human cohorts and mouse models investigated. The time of appearance of the first tumors was decreased and the number of tumoral foci induced by diethylnitrosamine was significantly increased by miR-22-deficiency in vivo, two features which were further drastically exacerbated with diet-induced obesity. At the molecular level, we provide evidence that the loss of miR-22 significantly affects the energetic metabolism and mitochondrial functions of hepatocytes, and the expression of tumor-promoting factors such as thrombospondin-1. Our study demonstrates that miR-22 acts as a hepatic tumor suppressor in vivo by restraining pro-carcinogenic metabolic deregulations through pleiotropic mechanisms and the overexpression of relevant oncogenes.\",\n",

They have shown immunomodulation properties as well as effects in improving tissue regeneration. To better stimulate and preserve the therapeutic properties of hADMSCs, biomaterials for cell delivery have been studied extensively. To date, hyaluronic acid (HA)-based materials have been most widely adopted by researchers around the world. PGmatrix is a new peptide-based hydrogel that has shown superior functional properties in 3D cell cultures. Here, we reported the in vitro and in vivo functional effects of PGmatrix on hADMSCs in comparison with HA and HA-based Hystem hydrogels. Our results showed that PGmatrix was far superior in maintaining hADMSC viability during prolonged incubation and stimulated expression of SSEA4 (stage-specific embryonic antigen-4) in hADMSCs. hADMSCs encapsulated in PGmatrix secreted more immune-responsive proteins than those in HA or Hystem, though similar VEGF-A and TGF\\u03b21 release levels were observed in all three hydrogels. In vivo studies revealed that hADMSCs encapsulated with PGmatrix showed improved skin wound healing in diabetic-induced mice at an early stage, suggesting possible anti-inflammatory effects, though similar re-epithelialization and collagen density were observed among PGmatrix and HA or Hystem hydrogels by day 21.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Recent advancements in regenerative medicine have enhanced the development of biomaterials as multi-functional dressings, capable of accelerating wound healing and addressing the challenge of chronic wounds. Hydrogels obtained from decellularized tissues have a complex composition, comparable to the native extracellular environment, showing highly interesting characteristics for wound healing applications. In this study, a bovine pericardium decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) hydrogel was characterized in terms of macromolecules content, and its immunomodulatory, angiogenic and wound healing potential has been evaluated. The polarization profile of human monocytes-derived macrophages seeded on dECM hydrogel was assessed by RT-qPCR. Angiogenic markers expression has been evaluated by Western blot and antibody array on cell lysates derived from endothelial cells cultured on dECM hydrogel, and a murine in vivo model of hindlimb ischemia was used to evaluate the angiogenic potential. Fibroblast migration was assessed by a transwell migration assay, and an in vivo murine wound healing model treated with dECM hydrogels was also used. The results showed a complex composition, of which the major component is collagen type I. The dECM hydrogel is biocompatible, able to drive M2 phenotype polarization, stimulate the expression of angiogenic markers in vitro, and prevent loss of functionality in hindlimb ischemia model. Furthermore, it drives fibroblast migration and shows ability to facilitate wound closure in vivo, demonstrating its great potential for regenerative applications.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely related to the occurrence and development of cancer. Abnormally expressed lncRNA can be used as a diagnostic marker for cancer. In this study, we aim to investigate the clinical significance of MIR99AHG expression in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and its biological roles in LUAD progression.\\nThe relative expression of MIR99AHG in LUAD tissues and cell lines was analyzed using public databases and RT-qPCR. The biological functions of MIR99AHG were investigated using a loss-of-function approach. The effect of MIR99AHG on lung fibrosis was assessed by scratch assay, invasion assay and lung fibrosis rat model. FISH, luciferase reporter assay and immunofluorescence were performed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.\\nLncRNA MIR99AHG expression level was downregulated in LUAD tissues and cell lines. Low MIR99AHG levels were associated with poorer patient overall survival. Functional analysis showed that MIR99AHG is associated with the LUAD malignant phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic studies showed that, MIR99AHG functions as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to antagonize miR-136-5p-mediated ubiquitin specific protease 4 (USP4) degradation, thereby unregulated the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a downstream target gene of USP4, which in turn affected alveolar type II epithelial cell fibrosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In summary, the MIR99AHG/miR-136-5p/USP4/ACE2 signalling axis regulates lung fibrosis and EMT, thus inhibiting LUAD progression.\\nThis study showed that downregulated MIR99AHG leads to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, overexpression of MIR99AHG may provide a new approach to preventing LUAD progression.\",\n",

Circular RNA (circRNA) participates in atherosclerosis (AS)-related inflammation responses; however, whether and how circ_0086296 regulates atherosclerotic inflammation and lesions have not been investigated. Microarray analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in\\u00a0situ hybridization assay were performed to detect the expression and location of hsa_circ_0086296 in human carotid artery plaques, aorta of atherosclerotic mice, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Sanger sequencing was used to verify the loop structure of circ_0086296. The relationship among circ_0086296, miR-576-3p, IFIT1, STAT1, and EIF4A3 was validated using bioinformatics, luciferase assay, RNA pull-down assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation. The atherosclerosis mouse model was used to evaluate the function of circ_0086296 in\\u00a0vivo. circ_0086296 expression was significantly upregulated in human carotid artery plaques, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL)-treated HUVECs, and the aorta of atherosclerotic mice. Functional analysis indicated that circ_0086296 promotes ECs injury in\\u00a0vitro and atherosclerosis progression in\\u00a0vivo. The mechanism analysis indicated that circ_0086296 sponged miR-576-3p to promote IFIT1-STAT1 expression. Moreover, STAT1 upregulated circ_0086296 expression, forming the circ_0086296/miR-576-3p/IFIT1/STAT1 feedback loop. Notably, inhibition of the circ_0086296/miR-576-3p/IFIT1 axis could block atherosclerotic lesion formation both in\\u00a0vivo and in\\u00a0vitro. Finally, circ_0086296 was overexpressed in exosomes of patients with atherosclerosis and exosomes of ox-LDL-treated ECs. Therefore, the circ_0086296/miR-576-3p/IFIT1/STAT1 feedback loop participates in atherosclerosis progression and contributes to the high circ_0086296 expression observed in the exosomes of serum of patients with atherosclerosis. This study sought to provide a deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying the aberrant EC phenotype in AS.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Effective drug delivery to the brain is critical for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive and invasive primary brain tumor that has a dismal prognosis. Radiation therapy, the mainstay of brain tumor treatment, works by inducing DNA damage. Therefore, inhibiting DNA damage response (DDR) pathways can sensitize tumor cells to radiation and enhance cytotoxicity. AZD1390 is an inhibitor of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase, a critical regulator of DDR. Our in vivo studies in the mouse indicate that delivery of AZD1390 to the central nervous system (CNS) is restricted due to active efflux by P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The free fraction of AZD1390 in brain and spinal cord were found to be low, thereby reducing the partitioning of free drug to these organs. Coadministration of an efflux inhibitor significantly increased CNS exposure of AZD1390. No differences were observed in distribution of AZD1390 within different anatomic regions of CNS, and the functional activity of P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein also remained the same across brain regions. In an intracranial GBM patient-derived xenograft model, AZD1390 accumulation was higher in the tumor core and rim compared with surrounding brain. Despite this heterogenous delivery within tumor-bearing brain, AZD1390 concentrations in normal brain, tumor rim, and tumor core were above in vitro effective radiosensitizing concentrations. These results indicate that despite being a substrate of efflux in the mouse brain, sufficient AZD1390 exposure is anticipated even in regions of normal brain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Given the invasive nature of glioblastoma (GBM), tumor cells are often protected by an intact blood-brain barrier, requiring the development of brain-penetrant molecules for effective treatment. We show that efflux mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) limits central nervous system (CNS) distribution of AZD1390 and that there are no distributional differences within anatomical regions of CNS. Despite efflux by P-gp, concentrations effective for potent radiosensitization are achieved in GBM tumor-bearing mouse brains, indicating that AZD1390 is an attractive molecule for clinical development of brain tumors.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The role of inflammatory immune responses in colorectal cancer (CRC) development and response to therapy is a matter of intense debate. While inflammation is a known driver of CRC, inflammatory immune infiltrates are a positive prognostic factor in CRC and predispose to response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Unfortunately, over 85% of CRC cases are primarily unresponsive to ICB due to the absence of an immune infiltrate, and even the cases that show an initial immune infiltration can become refractory to ICB. The identification of therapy supportive immune responses in the field has been partially hindered by the sparsity of suitable mouse models to recapitulate the human disease. In this study, we aimed to understand how the dysregulation of the complement anaphylatoxin C3a receptor (C3aR), observed in subsets of patients with CRC, affects the immune responses, the development of CRC, and response to ICB therapy.\\nWe use a comprehensive approach encompassing analysis of publicly available human CRC datasets, inflammation-driven and newly generated spontaneous mouse models of CRC, and multiplatform high-dimensional analysis of immune responses using microbiota sequencing, RNA sequencing, and mass cytometry.\\nWe found that patients' regulation of the complement C3aR is associated with epigenetic modifications. Specifically, downregulation of \\nOur findings reveal that C3aR may act as a previously unrecognized checkpoint to enhance antitumor immunity in CRC. C3aR can thus be exploited to overcome ICB resistance in a larger group of patients with CRC.\",\n",

However, clinical translation of cancer vaccines remained challenging due to weak tumor antigen immunogenicity, inefficient in vivo delivery, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Nanomaterials-based photothermal treatment (PTT) triggers immunogenic cell death while providing in situ tumor-associated antigens for subsequent anti-tumor immunity. Here, an in situ photothermal nano-vaccine (designated as BCNCCM) based on cancer cell membrane (CCM) was explored by co-encapsulating immune adjuvant CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) loaded black phosphorus-Au (BP-Au) nanosheets together with an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor (NLG919) by CCM, for the elimination of primary and metastatic breast tumors. The nano-vaccine could be delivered to tumor site selectively by CCM targeting and exhibit vaccine-like functions through the combined effect of in situ generated tumor-associate agents after PTT and immune adjuvant CpG, resulting in trigger of tumor-specific immunity. Furthermore, tumor inhibition was enhanced owing to the reversed immunosuppressive microenvironment mediated by IDO inhibitors. The nano-vaccine not only had good therapeutic effect on primary and metastatic tumors, but also could prevent tumor recurrence by producing systemic immune memory. Therefore, the photothermal nano-vaccine which coordinate in situ vaccine-like function and immune modulation may be a promising stragegy for photo-immunotherapy of metastatic tumors.\",\n",

It is important to develop neutralizing anti-HCV antibodies to prevent medical and accidental infection, such as might occur via liver transplantation of chronic HCV patients and needle-stick accidents in the clinic. In this study, we sought to obtain anti-HCV antibodies using phage display screening. Phages displaying human hepatocellular carcinoma patient-derived antibodies were screened by 4 rounds of biopanning with genotype-1b and -2a HCV envelope E2 protein adsorbed to magnetic beads. The three antibodies obtained from this screen had reactivity against E2 proteins derived from both genotype-1b and -2a strains. However, in epitope analysis, these antibodies did not recognize linear peptides from an overlapping E2 epitope peptide library, and did not bind to denatured E2 protein. In addition, these antibodies showed cross-genotypic neutralizing activity against genotype-1a, -1b, -2a, and -3a cell culture-generated infectious HCV particles (HCVcc). Moreover, emergence of viral escape mutants was not observed after repeated rounds of passaging of HCV-infected cells in the presence of one such antibody, e2d066. Furthermore, injection of the e2d066 antibody into human hepatocyte-transplanted immunodeficient mice inhibited infection by J6/JFH-1 HCVcc. In conclusion, we identified conformational epitope-recognizing, cross-genotypic neutralizing antibodies using phage display screening. Notably, e2d066 antibody did not select for escape mutant emergence in vitro and demonstrated neutralizing activity in vivo. Our results suggested that these antibodies may serve as prophylactic and therapeutic agents.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been shown to play critical regulatory roles in multiple myeloma progression. Here, we aimed to explore the biologic role of circ_0005615 in multiple myeloma progression and its associated mechanism. Cell counting kit-8 assay was conducted to analyze the bortezomib resistance and proliferation of multiple myeloma cells. Cell proliferation was also analyzed by 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and flow cytometry assays. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The interaction between microRNA-185-5p (miR-185-5p) and circ_0005615 or interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. A xenograft tumor model was established in non-obese diabetic/server combined immune-deficiency mice to analyze the roles of circ_0005615 in tumor growth and bortezomib resistance. Circ_0005615 was upregulated in multiple myeloma tissues and cell lines. Circ_0005615 knockdown restrained the bortezomib resistance and proliferation and induced the apoptosis of multiple myeloma cells. Circ_0005615 acted as a molecular sponge for miR-185-5p, and the antitumor effects mediated by circ_0005615 knockdown were reversed by silencing miR-185-5p. IRF4 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-185-5p, and miR-185-5p overexpression-induced antitumor influences could be counteracted by IRF4 overexpression. Circ_0005615 could positively regulate IRF4 expression by sponging miR-185-5p in multiple myeloma cells. Circ_0005615 knockdown suppressed the growth and bortezomib resistance of xenograft tumors in vivo. Circ_0005615 contributed to the malignant progression and bortezomib resistance of multiple myeloma through mediating miR-185-5p/IRF4 signaling.\",\n",

However, whether exosomal circRNA Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 2 (circ-SFMBT2) was involved in the chemoresistance of prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. The docetaxel (DTX) resistance of PCa cells was analyzed by Cell Counting Kit 8 assay. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure circSFMBT2, microRNA (miR)-136-5p and tribbles homolog 1 (TRIB1) expression. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were analyzed by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, flow cytometry, wound-healing assay and transwell assay. RNA interaction was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Protein expression was measured by western blot analysis. Exosomes-extracted from cells were identified by transmission electron microscope, nanoparticles tracking analysis and western blot. Xenograft mice models were constructed to analyze the effect of exosomal circSFMBT2 on the DTX sensitivity of PCa tumors in vivo. CircSFMBT2 was upregulated in DTX-resistant PCa cells, and its knockdown enhanced the DTX sensitivity of DTX-resistant PCa cells by suppressing cell proliferation, migration, invasion and enhancing apoptosis. CircSFMBT2 severed as miR-136-5p sponge to positively regulate TRIB1. The regulation of circSFMBT2 knockdown on the DTX sensitivity of DTX-resistant PCa cells could be reversed by miR-136-5p inhibitor or TRIB1 overexpression. Exosomal circSFMBT2 from DTX-resistant PCa could increase the DTX resistance of normal PCa cells. In addition, exosomal circSFMBT2 also enhanced the DTX resistance of PCa tumors in vivo, and it was highly expressed in the serum of DTX-resistance PCa patients. Exosomal circSFMBT2 enhanced the DTX resistance of PCa by miR-136-5p/TRIB1 axis, indicating that circSFMBT2 might be a potential target for the treatment of PCa chemoresistance.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) shows recurrence and lung metastasis even after treatment. 23-hydroxybetulinic acid (23-HBA), a major active constituent of Pulsatilla chinensis, exhibits potent antitumor activities. We herein investigate the biological effect of 23-HBA on metastasis and immunosuppression in a mouse model of HCC. Microarray-based gene expression profiling was employed to identify the target genes of 23-HBA in the treatment of HCC. The effect of 23-HBA on the progression of HCC was evaluated by in-vitro cell function measurements along with in-vivo xenograft implantation, lung metastasis and CD11b+Gr1+ staining experiments. The potential mechanism involving target signaling pathway was investigated by western blot analysis. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) was a key target gene mediated by 23-HBA in HCC, whereas Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis demonstrated that MMP2 mainly affects the development and metastasis of HCC. 23-HBA significantly reduced cell malignant functions in vitro while delaying the HCC growth and metastasis in vivo. In addition, the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells was shown to be reduced following administration of 23-HBA in mice. Mechanistic analysis indicated that these effects of 23-HBA during HCC were involved with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway inactivation and resulted in decreased phosphorylation of both mitogen-activated protein kinases 1/2 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Our study reveals that 23-HBA acts as a tumor suppressor agent and suppresses HCC tumorigenesis, metastasis and immunosuppression via blockade of the MAPK signaling pathway, suggesting that 23-HBA may serve as a promising drug target to treat HCC.\",\n",

The changes that accompany renal failure are likely to influence the gut microbiota, or the ecosystem of micro-organisms resident in the intestine. Altered gut microbiota can display metabolic changes and become harmful to the host. To study the gut-kidney axis in vivo, animal models should ideally reproduce the disorders affecting both the host and the gut microbiota. Murine models of CKD, but not dog, manifest slowed gut transit, similarly to patient. Animal models of CKD also reproduce altered intestinal barrier function, as well as the resulting leaky gut syndrome and bacterial translocation. CKD animal models replicate metabolic but not compositional changes in the gut microbiota. Researchers investigating the gut-kidney axis should pay attention to the selection of the animal model (disease induction method, species) and the setting of the experimental design (control group, sterilization method, individually ventilated cages) that have been shown to influence gut microbiota.\",\n",

The oral toxicity of OA is complex, and the mechanism of toxicity is not clear. The interaction between OA and gut microbiota may provide a reasonable explanation for the complex toxicity of OA. Due to the complex environment in vivo, an in vitro study may be better for the interactions between OA and gut microbiome. Here, we conducted an in vitro fermentation experiment of gut bacteria in the presence of 0-1000 nM OA. The remolding ability of OA on bacterial composition was investigated by 16S rDNA sequencing, and differential metabolites in fermentation system with different concentration of OA was detected by LC-MS/MS. We found that OA inhibited some specific bacterial genera but promoted others. In addition, eight possible metabolites of OA, including dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2), were detected in the fermentation system. The abundance of \",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Liver fibrosis is mainly characterized by the formation of fibrous scars. Galactosylated chitosan (GC) has gained increasing attention as a liver-targeted drug carrier in recent years. The present study aimed to investigate the availability of betulinic acid-loaded GC nanoparticles (BA-GC-NPs) for liver protection. Covalently-conjugated galactose, recognized by asialoglycoprotein receptors exclusively expressed in hepatocytes, was employed to target the liver.\\nGalactose was coupled to chitosan by chemical covalent binding. BA-GC-NPs were synthesized by wrapping BA into NPs via ion-crosslinking method. The potential advantage of BA-GC-NP as a liver-targeting agent in the treatment of liver fibrosis has been demonstrated in vivo and in vitro.\\nBA-GC-NPs with diameters <200 nm were manufactured in a virtually spherical core-shell arrangement, and BA was released consistently and continuously for 96 h, as assessed by an in vitro release assay. According to the safety evaluation, BA-GC-NPs demonstrated good biocompatibility at the cellular level and did not generate any inflammatory reaction in mice. Importantly, BA-GC-NPs showed an inherent liver-targeting potential in the uptake behavioral studies in cells and bioimaging tests in vivo. Efficacy tests revealed that administering BA-GC-NPs in a mouse model of liver fibrosis reduced the degree of liver injury in mice.\\nThe findings showed that BA-GC-NPs form a safe and effective anti-hepatic fibrosis medication delivery strategy.\",\n",

PDCD6 (programmed cell death 6) is an established proapoptotic regulator which is responsible for motoneuronal death. However, its potential regulatory role in post-spinal cord injury (SCI) regeneration has remained largely unknown. Further investigations are warranted to clarify the involvement of PDCD6 post-SCI recovery and the underlying mechanisms. In our study, based on bioinformatics prediction, we found that miR-34a-3p might be an upstream regulator miRNA for PDCD6, which was subsequently validated through combined utilization of the qRT-PCR, western blot, and dual-luciferase reporter system.

      "    \"abstract\": \"A key aspect of any new material safety assessment is the evaluation of their in vivo genotoxicity. Graphene oxide (GO) has been studied for many promising applications, but there are remaining concerns about its safety profile, especially after inhalation. Herein we tested whether GO lateral dimension, comparing micrometric (LGO) and nanometric (USGO) GO sheets, has a role in the formation of DNA double strand breaks in mouse lungs. We used spatial resolution and differential cell type analysis to measure DNA damages in both epithelial and immune cells, after either single or repeated exposure.\\nGO induced DNA damages were size and dose dependent, in both exposure scenario. After single exposure to a high dose, both USGO and LGO induced significant DNA damage in the lung parenchyma, but only during the acute phase response (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05 for USGO; p\\u2009<\\u20090.01 for LGO). This was followed by a fast lung recovery at day 7 and 28 for both GOs. When evaluating the chronic impact of GO after repeated exposure, only a high dose of LGO induced long-term DNA damages in lung alveolar epithelia (at 84\\u00a0days, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Regardless of size, low dose GO did not induce any significant DNA damage after repeated exposure. A multiparametric correlation analysis of our repeated exposure data revealed that transient or persistent inflammation and oxidative stress were associated to either recovery or persistent DNA damages. For USGO, recovery from DNA damage was correlated to efficient recovery from acute inflammation (i.e., significant secretion of SAA3, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001; infiltration of neutrophils, p\\u2009<\\u20090.01). In contrast, the persistence of LGO in lungs was associated to a long-lasting presence of multinucleated macrophages (up to 84\\u00a0days, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05), an underlying inflammation (IL-1\\u03b1 secretion up to 28\\u00a0days, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and the presence of persistent DNA damages at 84\\u00a0days.\\nOverall these results highlight the importance of the exposure scenario used. We showed that LGO was more genotoxic after repeated exposure than single exposure due to persistent lung inflammation. These findings are important in the context of human health risk assessment and toward establishing recommendations for a safe use of graphene based materials in the workplace.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare genetic disease characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) in soft tissues due to a heterozygous mutation of the ACVR1A gene (FOP-ACVR1A), which erroneously transduces the BMP signal by Activin-A. Although inflammation is known to trigger HO in FOP, the role of FOP-ACVR1A on inflammatory cells remains to be elucidated.\\nWe generated immortalized monocytic cell lines from FOP-iPSCs (FOP-ML) and mutation rescued iPSCs (resFOP-ML). Cell morphology was evaluated during the monocyte induction and after immortalization. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed to evaluate the cell surface markers CD14 and CD16 on MLs. MLs were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or Activin-A and the gene expression was evaluated by quantitative PCR and microarray analysis. Histological analysis was performed for HO tissue obtained from wild type mice and FOP-ACVR1A mice which conditionally express human mutant ACVR1A gene by doxycycline administration. Without any stimulation, FOP-ML showed the pro-inflammatory signature of CD16+\\u2009monocytes with an upregulation of INHBA gene, and treatment of resFOP-ML with Activin-A induced an expression profile mimicking that of FOP-ML at baseline. Treatment of FOP-ML with Activin-A further induced the inflammatory profile with an up-regulation of inflammation-associated genes, of which some, but not all, of which were suppressed by corticosteroid. Experiments using an inhibitor for TGF\\u03b2 or BMP signal demonstrated that Activin-A-induced genes such as CD16 and CCL7, were regulated by both signals, indicating Activin-A transduced dual signals in FOP-ML. A comparison with resFOP-ML identified several down-regulated genes in FOP-ML including LYVE-1, which is known to suppress matrix-formation in vivo. The down-regulation of LYVE-1 in HO tissues was confirmed in FOP model mice, verifying the significance of the in vitro experiments.\\nThese results indicate that FOP-ML faithfully recapitulated the phenotype of primary monocytes of FOP and the combination with resFOP-ML is a useful tool to investigate molecular events at the initial inflammation stage of HO in FOP.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) confers Th17-cells immunosuppressive features by activating aryl-hydrocarbon-receptor, a modulator of toxin and adaptive immune responses. In Crohn's disease, Th17-cells fail to acquire regulatory properties in response to UCB, remaining at an inflammatory/pathogenic state. Here we show that UCB modulates Th17-cell metabolism by limiting glycolysis and through downregulation of glycolysis-related genes, namely phosphoglycerate-kinase-1 (PGK1) and aldolase-A (ALDOA). Th17-cells of Crohn's disease patients display heightened PGK1 and ALDOA and defective response to UCB. Silencing of PGK1 or ALDOA restores Th17-cell response to UCB, as reflected by increase in immunoregulatory markers like FOXP3, IL-10 and CD39. In vivo, PGK1 and ALDOA silencing enhances UCB salutary effects in trinitro-benzene-sulfonic-acid-induced colitis in NOD/scid/gamma humanized mice where control over disease activity and enhanced immunoregulatory phenotypes are achieved. PGK1 and/or ALDOA blockade might have therapeutic effects in Crohn's disease by favoring acquisition of regulatory properties by Th17-cells along with control over their pathogenic potential.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Psoriasis is characterized by hyperproliferative keratinocytes, dilated capillaries and leukocyte infiltration. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME) has shown significant inhibition on proliferation, angiogenesis and inflammation. To evaluate the anti-psoriatic potential of 2-ME, psoriasis-like dermatitis was induced by topical application of imiquimod (IMQ) on the dorsal skin of C57BL/6 mice for seven consecutive days, followed by treatment of vehicle or 2-ME ointment from Day 4 on. The psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) was assessed daily. On Day 8, skin histology and spleen index were assessed. The effects of 2-ME on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways of HaCaT cells stimulated by interleukin-17 (IL-17A) were detected, together with its effect on the proliferation, tube formation and VEGF receptor expression of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We found that topical 2-ME treatment significantly improved IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis and decreased the PASI scores, the activation of STAT3 in the skin (P\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05), and the spleen index in mice (P\\u00a0<\\u00a00.01). In vitro, 2-ME inhibited the proliferation of HaCaT cells by inducing apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest (P\\u00a0<\\u00a00.01). Moreover, 2-ME suppressed IL-17A-induced VEGFA (2.5\\u00a0\\u03bcM: P\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05; 5\\u00a0\\u03bcM: P\\u00a0<\\u00a00.01) and phosphorylation of STAT3 by blocking p-JAK1 in HaCaT cells and prevented tube formation (P\\u00a0<\\u00a00.01) and proliferation by targeting VEGF receptors 1 (VEGFR1) and 2 (VEGFR2) in HUVECs. We conclude that 2-ME alleviated psoriasis in vivo and in vitro by inhibiting JAK1/STAT3 pathway and was a promising therapeutic agent for psoriasis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Periodontal disease (PD) is one of the most common inflammatory diseases in humans and is initiated by an oral microbial dysbiosis that stimulates inflammation and bone loss. Here, we report an abnormal elevation of succinate in the subgingival plaque of subjects with severe PD. Succinate activates succinate receptor-1 (SUCNR1) and stimulates inflammation. We detected SUCNR1 expression in the human and mouse periodontium and hypothesize that succinate activates SUCNR1 to accelerate periodontitis through the inflammatory response. Administration of exogenous succinate enhanced periodontal disease, whereas SUCNR1 knockout mice were protected from inflammation, oral dysbiosis, and subsequent periodontal bone loss in two different models of periodontitis. Therapeutic studies demonstrated that a SUCNR1 antagonist inhibited inflammatory events and osteoclastogenesis in\\u00a0vitro and reduced periodontal bone loss in\\u00a0vivo. Our study reveals succinate's effect on periodontitis pathogenesis and provides a topical treatment for this disease.\",\n",

However, the central neuronal links between hypothalamic oxytocinergic neurons and the autonomic nervous system remain unclear. Here we show that oxytocinergic neurons in the rat paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), a pivotal site for energy homeostasis, innervate sympathetic premotor neurons in the rostral medullary raphe region (rMR) to stimulate brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and cardiovascular functions. Oxytocin receptor stimulation in the rMR evokes BAT thermogenesis and tachycardia. In\\u00a0vivo optogenetic stimulation of the PVH\\u2192rMR long-range oxytocinergic pathway, using a virus-mediated system for amplified gene expression in oxytocinergic neurons, not only elicits BAT thermogenic and cardiac responses but also potentiates sympathetic responses evoked by glutamatergic transmission in the rMR. The PVH\\u2192rMR oxytocinergic pathway connects the hypothalamic circuit for energy homeostasis to thermogenic and cardiac sympathetic outflow, and, therefore, its defects may cause obesity and impaired thermoregulation, as seen in Prader-Willi syndrome.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Myelin transcription factor 1 like (Myt1l), a zinc-finger transcription factor, promotes neuronal differentiation and is implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability. However, it remains unclear whether Myt1l promotes neuronal differentiation in\\u00a0vivo and its deficiency in mice leads to disease-related phenotypes. Here, we report that Myt1l-heterozygous mutant (Myt1l-HT) mice display postnatal age-differential ASD-related phenotypes: newborn Myt1l-HT mice, with strong Myt1l expression, show ASD-like transcriptomic changes involving decreased synaptic gene expression and prefrontal excitatory synaptic transmission and altered righting reflex. Juvenile Myt1l-HT mice, with markedly decreased Myt1l expression, display reverse ASD-like transcriptomes, increased prefrontal excitatory transmission, and largely normal behaviors. Adult Myt1l-HT mice show ASD-like transcriptomes involving astrocytic and microglial gene upregulation,\\u00a0increased prefrontal inhibitory transmission, and behavioral deficits. Therefore, Myt1l haploinsufficiency leads to ASD-related phenotypes in newborn mice, which are temporarily normalized in juveniles but re-appear in adults, pointing to continuing phenotypic changes long after a marked decrease of Myt1l expression in juveniles.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Trypanosoma vivax is a unicellular hemoparasite, and a principal cause of animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT), a vector-borne and potentially fatal livestock disease across sub-Saharan Africa. Previously, we identified diverse T. vivax-specific genes that were predicted to encode cell surface proteins. Here, we examine the immune responses of naturally and experimentally infected hosts to these unique parasite antigens, to identify immunogens that could become vaccine candidates. Immunoprofiling of host serum shows that one particular family (Fam34) elicits a consistent IgG antibody response. This gene family, which we now call Vivaxin, encodes at least 124 transmembrane glycoproteins that display quite distinct expression profiles and patterns of genetic variation. We focused on one gene (viv-\\u03b28) that encodes one particularly immunogenic vivaxin protein and which is highly expressed during infections but displays minimal polymorphism across the parasite population. Vaccination of mice with VIV\\u03b28 adjuvanted with Quil-A elicits a strong, balanced immune response and delays parasite proliferation in some animals but, ultimately, it does not prevent disease. Although VIV\\u03b28 is localized across the cell body and flagellar membrane, live immunostaining indicates that VIV\\u03b28 is largely inaccessible to antibody in vivo. However, our phylogenetic analysis shows that vivaxin includes other antigens shown recently to induce immunity against T. vivax. Thus, the introduction of vivaxin represents an important advance in our understanding of the T. vivax cell surface. Besides being a source of proven and promising vaccine antigens, the gene family is clearly an important component of the parasite glycocalyx, with potential to influence host-parasite interactions.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"No vaccines or specific antiviral drugs are authorized against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) despite its high mortality rate and prevalence in dromedary camels. Since 2012, MERS-CoV has been causing sporadic zoonotic infections in humans, which poses a risk of genetic evolution to become a pandemic virus. MERS-CoV genome encodes five accessory proteins, 3, 4a, 4b, 5 and 8b for which limited information is available in the context of infection. This work describes 4b as a virulence factor in vivo, since the deletion mutant of a mouse-adapted MERS-CoV-\\u03944b (MERS-CoV-MA-\\u03944b) was completely attenuated in a humanized DPP4 knock-in mouse model, resulting in no mortality. Attenuation in the absence of 4b was associated with a significant reduction in lung pathology and chemokine expression levels at 4 and 6 days post-infection, suggesting that 4b contributed to the induction of lung inflammatory pathology. The accumulation of 4b in the nucleus in vivo was not relevant to virulence, since deletion of its nuclear localization signal led to 100% mortality. Interestingly, the presence of 4b protein was found to regulate autophagy in the lungs of mice, leading to upregulation of BECN1, ATG3 and LC3A mRNA. Further analysis in MRC-5 cell line showed that, in the context of infection, MERS-CoV-MA 4b inhibited autophagy, as confirmed by the increase of p62 and the decrease of ULK1 protein levels, either by direct or indirect mechanisms. Together, these results correlated autophagy activation in the absence of 4b with downregulation of a pathogenic inflammatory response, thus contributing to attenuation of MERS-CoV-MA-\\u03944b.\",\n",

We investigated the contribution of cholesterol derived from extracellular uptake by the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in the immunometabolic response of T cells. By combining proteomics, gene expression profiling, and immunophenotyping, we described a unique role for cholesterol provided by the LDLR pathway in CD8+ T cell activation. mRNA and protein expression of LDLR was significantly increased in activated CD8+ compared to CD4+ WT T cells, and this resulted in a significant reduction of proliferation and cytokine production (IFN\\u03b3, Granzyme B, and Perforin) of CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells from Ldlr -/- mice after in vitro and in vivo stimulation. This effect was the consequence of altered cholesterol routing to the lysosome resulting in a lower mTORC1 activation. Similarly, CD8+ T cells from humans affected by familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) carrying a mutation on the LDLR gene showed reduced activation after an immune challenge.\",\n",

Environmental factors correlated with the gut microbiota community have been implicated in the development of ADHD. However, whether different ADHD symptomatic presentations are associated with distinct microbiota compositions and whether patients could benefit from the correction of aberrant bacterial colonization are still largely unclear. We carried out metagenomic shotgun analysis with 207 human fecal samples to characterize the gut microbial profiles of patients with ADHD grouped according to their phenotypical presentation. Then, we transplanted the candidate low-abundance bacteria identified in patient subgroups into ADHD rats and evaluated ADHD-associated behaviors and neuronal activation in these rats. Patients with C-ADHD had a different gut microbial composition from that of healthy controls (HCs) (\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit two bidirectional immunomodulatory abilities: proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory regulatory effects. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have important functions in the immune system. Previously, we performed high-throughput sequencing comparing lncRNA expression profiles between MSCs cocultured with or without CD14+\\u2009monocytes and screened out a new lncRNA termed lncRNA MCP1 regulatory factor (MRF). However, the mechanism of MRF in MSCs is still unknown.\\nMRF expression was quantified via qRT-PCR. RNA interference and lentiviruses were used to regulate MRF expression. The immunomodulatory effects of MSCs on monocytes were evaluated via monocyte migration and macrophage polarization assays. RNA pull-down and mass spectrometry were utilized to identify downstream factors of MRF. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was applied to analyze the transcription factors regulating MRF. qRT-PCR, western blotting and ELISAs were used to assess MCP1 expression. A human monocyte adoptive transfer mouse model was applied to verify the function of MRF in vivo.\\nMRF was upregulated in MSCs during coculture with CD14+\\u2009monocytes. MRF increased monocyte recruitment by upregulating the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP1). Knockdown of MRF enhanced the regulatory effect of MSCs on restraining M1 polarization and facilitating M2 polarization. Mechanistically, MRF bound to the downstream protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (HNRNPD) to upregulate MCP1 expression, and the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) activated MRF transcription early during coculture. The human monocyte adoptive transfer model showed that MRF downregulation in MSCs inhibited monocyte chemotaxis and enhanced the effects of MSCs to inhibit M1 macrophage polarization and promote M2 polarization in vivo.\\nWe identified the new lncRNA MRF, which exhibits proinflammatory characteristics. MRF regulates the ability of MSCs to accelerate monocyte recruitment and modulate macrophage polarization through the HNRNPD-MCP1 axis and initiates the proinflammatory regulatory process in MSCs, suggesting that MRF is a potential target to improve the clinical effect of MSC-based therapy or correct MSC-related immunomodulatory dysfunction under pathological conditions.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Oxytocin, secreted by oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamus, is an endogenous neuropeptide involved in modulating multiple sensory information processing pathways, and its roles in the brain have been associated with prosocial, maternal, and feeding-related behaviors. Visual information is necessary for initiating these behaviors, with the retina consisting of the first stage in the visual system mediating external stimulus perception. Oxytocin has been detected in the mammalian retina; however, the expression and possible function of oxytocin receptors (OxtR) in the retina remain unknown. Here, we explore the role of oxytocin in regulating visual information processing in the retina.\\nWe observed that OxtR mRNA and protein are expressed in the mouse retina. With Oxtr-Cre transgenic mice, immunostaining, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that OxtRs are mainly expressed in GABAergic amacrine cells (ACs) in both the inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL). Further immunoreactivity studies showed that GABAergic OxtR\\nThese data indicate the functional expression of OxtRs in retinal GABAergic ACs, especially dopaminergic ACs, and expand the interactions between oxytocinergic and dopaminergic systems. This study suggests that visual perception, from the first stage of information processing in the retina, is modulated by hypothalamic oxytocin signaling.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Respiratory diseases represent a global health burden. Because research on therapeutic strategies of airway diseases is essential, the technique of precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) has been developed and widely studied. PCLS are an alternative ex vivo model and have the potential to replace and reduce in vivo animal models. So far, the majority of studies was conducted with short-term cultivated PCLS (\\u2264\\u200972\\u00a0h). As there is large interest in research of chronic diseases and chronic toxicity, feasibility of cultivating human PCLS long-term over 2\\u00a0weeks and recently over 4\\u00a0weeks was investigated by another research group with successful results. Our aim was to establish a model of long-term cultivated rat PCLS over a period of 29\\u00a0days.\\nRat PCLS were cultured for 29\\u00a0days and analysed regarding viability, histopathology, reactivity and gene expression at different time points during cultivation.\\nCultivation of rat PCLS over a 29-day time period was successful with sustained viability. Furthermore, the ability of bronchoconstriction was maintained between 13 and 25\\u00a0days, depending on the mediator. However, reduced relaxation, altered sensitivity and increased respiratory tone were observed. Regarding transcription, alteration in gene expression pattern of the investigated target genes was ascertained during long-term cultivation with mixed results. Furthermore, the preparation of PCLS seems to influence messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of most target genes. Moreover, the addition of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to the culture medium did not improve viability of PCLS. In contrast to medium without FBS, FBS seems to affect measurements and resulted in marked cellular changes of metaplastic and/or regenerative origin.\\nOverall, a model of long-term cultivated rat PCLS which stays viable for 29\\u00a0days and reactive for at least 13\\u00a0days could be established. Before long-term cultivated PCLS can be used for in-depth study of chronic diseases and chronic toxicity, further investigations have to be made.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a syndrome characterized by coagulopathy, microthrombus, and multiple organ failure. The complement system in DIC is overactivated, and the functions of complement and coagulation pathways are closely related. Our previous screening revealed that salvianolic acid A (SAA) has anti-complement activity. The hyper-activated complement system was involved in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced DIC in rats. The effects of SAA anti-complement action on LPS-induced DIC in rats were investigated.\\nThe complement activity of the classical pathway and alternative pathway was detected through an in vitro hemolysis assay. The binding sites of SAA and complement C3b were predicted by molecular docking. LPS-induced disseminated coagulation experiments were performed on male Wistar rats to assess coagulation function, complement activity, inflammation, biochemistry, blood routine, fibrinolysis, and survival.\\nSAA had an anti-complement activity in vivo and in vitro and inhibited the complement activation in the classical and alternative pathway of complement. The infusion of LPS into the rats impaired the coagulation function, increased the plasma inflammatory cytokine level, complemented activation, reduced the clotting factor levels, fibrinogen, and platelets, damaged renal, liver, and lung functions, and led to a high mortality rate (85%). SAA treatment of rats inhibited complement activation and attenuated the significant increase in D-dimer, interleukin-6, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine. It ameliorated the decrease in plasma levels of fibrinogen and platelets and reversed the decline in activity of protein C and antithrombin III. The treatment reduced kidney, liver, and lung damage, and significantly improved the survival rate of rats (46.2 and 78.6% for the low- and high-dose groups, respectively).\\nSAA reduced LPS-induced DIC by inhibiting complement activation. It has considerable potential in DIC treatment.\",\n",

The infusion of LPS into the rats impaired the coagulation function, increased the plasma inflammatory cytokine level, complemented activation, reduced the clotting factor levels, fibrinogen, and platelets, damaged renal, liver, and lung functions, and led to a high mortality rate (85%). SAA treatment of rats inhibited complement activation and attenuated the significant increase in D-dimer, interleukin-6, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine. It ameliorated the decrease in plasma levels of fibrinogen and platelets and reversed the decline in activity of protein C and antithrombin III. The treatment reduced kidney, liver, and lung damage, and significantly improved the survival rate of rats (46.2 and 78.6% for the low- and high-dose groups, respectively).\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Cooking oil fumes (COFs) represent a major indoor environmental pollutant and exhibit potent mutagenic or carcinogenic health effects caused by containing various heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) and long-chain aldehydes. Despite some evaluation of the cumulative exposure of COFs to cancer cells under high concentration were evaluated, their biological adverse effects with low-dose exposure to healthy cells had been inadequately investigated. Herein, we firstly scrutinized the three selected typically toxic compounds of heterocyclic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), 3,8-dimethylammidazo[4,5-f]quinoxalin-2-amine (MeIQx) and trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (TDA)) emitted from COFs. In vitro studies revealed that the PhIP, MeIQx and TDA aerosol particles were negligible toxicity to cancer cells (A549 and HepG-2) but strong cytotoxicity to normal healthy cells (HelF and L02) under 0.5-4\\u00a0\\u03bcg/mL low dose exposure based on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) mechanism. In vivo studies demonstrated that PhIP caused significant lung and liver damage after exposure to PhIP for 30\\u00a0days with mice. These results indicated the direct proof of healthy cell damage even at low-dose exposure to HAAs and aldehydes.\",\n",

Here we introduce a class of smart soft contact lenses, enabling the continuous 24-hour monitoring of intraocular pressure, even during sleep. Uniquely, the smart soft contact lenses are built upon various commercial brands of soft contact lenses without altering their intrinsic properties such as lens power, biocompatibility, softness, transparency, wettability, oxygen transmissibility, and overnight wearability. We show that the smart soft contact lenses can seamlessly fit across different corneal curvatures and thicknesses in human eyes and therefore accurately measure absolute intraocular pressure under ambulatory conditions. We perform a comprehensive set of in vivo evaluations in rabbit, dog, and human eyes from normal to hypertension to confirm the superior measurement accuracy, within-subject repeatability, and user comfort of the smart soft contact lenses beyond current wearable ocular tonometers. We envision that the smart soft contact lenses will be effective in glaucoma care.\",\n",

Here, we investigate the effect of diabetes, and high glucose on the expression of the antimicrobial peptide, psoriasin and the putative consequences for E. coli urinary tract infection. Blood, urine, and urine exfoliated cells from patients are studied. The influence of glucose and insulin is examined during hyperglycemic clamps in individuals with prediabetes and in euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamped patients with type 1 diabetes. Important findings are confirmed in vivo in type 2 diabetic mice and verified in human uroepithelial cell lines. High glucose concentrations induce lower psoriasin levels and impair epithelial barrier function together with altering cell membrane proteins and cytoskeletal elements, resulting in increasing bacterial burden. Estradiol treatment restores the cellular function with increasing psoriasin and bacterial killing in uroepithelial cells, confirming its importance during urinary tract infection in hyperglycemia. In conclusion, our findings present the effects and underlying mechanisms of high glucose compromising innate immunity.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a highly malignant brain tumor in infants that is characterized by loss of nuclear expression of SMARCB1 or SMARCA4 proteins. Recent studies show that AT/RTs comprise three molecular subgroups, namely AT/RT-TYR, AT/RT-MYC and AT/RT-SHH. The subgroups show distinct expression patterns of genes involved in ciliogenesis, however, little is known about the functional roles of primary cilia in the biology of AT/RT. Here, we show that primary cilia are present across all AT/RT subgroups with specific enrichment in AT/RT-TYR patient samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that primary ciliogenesis contributes to AT/RT biology in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, we observed a significant decrease in proliferation and clonogenicity following disruption of primary ciliogenesis in AT/RT cell line models. Additionally, apoptosis was significantly increased via the induction of STAT1 and DR5 signaling, as detected by proteogenomic profiling. In a Drosophila model of SMARCB1 deficiency, concomitant knockdown of several cilia-associated genes resulted in a substantial shift of the lethal phenotype with more than 20% of flies reaching adulthood. We also found significantly extended survival in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of AT/RT upon disruption of primary ciliogenesis. Taken together, our findings indicate that primary ciliogenesis or its downstream signaling contributes to the aggressiveness of AT/RT and, therefore, may constitute a novel therapeutic target.\",\n",

How cancer cells acquire metastatic potency through the conversion of noncancer stem-like cells into cancer cells with stem-cell properties is poorly understood. Here, we identified the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) TGFB2-AS1 as an important regulator of the reversibility and plasticity of noncancer stem cell populations in TNBC. We revealed that TGFB2-AS1 impairs the breast cancer stem-like cell (BCSC) traits of TNBC cells in\\u00a0vitro and dramatically decreases tumorigenic frequency and lung metastasis in\\u00a0vivo. Mechanistically, TGFB2-AS1 interacts with SMARCA4, a core subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, and results in transcriptional repression of its target genes including \",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Lipid formulations for cell transfection are among the most efficient systems for nucleic acid delivery. During the COVID-19 pandemic, lipid-encapsulated RNA (lipid nanoparticles, LNP) has succeeded as a superior vaccine. Moreover, other similar lipid nanocarriers for siRNA are approved and many are on the pipelines. While lipid encapsulation required several devices for the mixing of components, lipoplex technology allows to rapidly mix nucleic acids and positively charged lipids for cell transfection. In vivo, hepatocytes are important target cells of lipid formulated RNAi. This chapter describes the state-of-the-art lipoplex and LPN manufacturing for treating primary hepatocytes with lipid formulations. Furthermore, protocols for isolating murine hepatocytes and for transfecting these cells with pharmaceutically relevant lipid formulations are provided and discussed.\",\n",

Although these patients have relatively favorable prognoses, substantial numbers of them would relapse after conventional therapy. Here, we explored whether reinforcing the endogenous differentiation potential of t(8;21) AML cells would diminish the associated malignancy. In doing so, we noticed an expansion of immature erythroid blasts featured in both AML1-ETO9a (AE9a) and AE plus c-KIT (N822K) (AK) murine leukemic models. Interestingly, in the AE9a murine model, a spontaneous step-wise erythroid differentiation path, as characterized by the differential expression of CD43/c-Kit and the upregulation of several key erythroid transcription factors (TFs), accompanied the decline or loss of leukemia-initiating potential. Notably, overexpression of one of the key erythroid TFs, Ldb1, potently disrupted the repopulation of AE9a leukemic cells in vivo, suggesting a new promising intervention strategy of t(8;21) AML through enforcing their erythroid differentiation.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"An innovative approach has been introduced for identifying and developing novel potent and safe anti-Babesia and anti-Theileria agents for the control of animal piroplasmosis. In the present study, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of Malaria Box (MBox) compounds (n\\u2009=\\u20098) against the growth of Babesia microti in mice and conducted bioinformatics analysis between the selected hits and the currently used antibabesial drugs, with far-reaching implications for potent combinations.\\nA fluorescence assay was used to evaluate the in vivo inhibitory effects of the selected compounds. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted using hierarchical clustering, distance matrix and molecular weight correlation, and PubChem fingerprint. The compounds with in vivo potential efficacy were selected to search for their target in the piroplasm parasites using quantitative PCR (qPCR).\\nScreening the MBox against the in vivo growth of the B.\\u00a0microti parasite enabled the discovery of potent new antipiroplasm drugs, including MMV396693 and MMV665875. Interestingly, statistically significant (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) downregulation of cysteine protease mRNA levels was observed in MMV665875-treated Theileria equi in vitro culture in comparison with untreated cultures. MMV396693/clofazimine and MMV665875/atovaquone (AV) showed maximum structural similarity (MSS) with each other. The distance matrix results indicate promising antibabesial efficacy of combination therapies consisting of either MMV665875 and AV or MMV396693 and imidocarb dipropionate (ID).\\nInhibitory and hematology assay results suggest that MMV396693 and MMV665875 are potent antipiroplasm monotherapies. The structural similarity results indicate that MMV665875 and MMV396693 have a similar mode of action as AV and ID, respectively. Our findings demonstrated that MBox compounds provide a promising lead for the development of new antibabesial therapeutic alternatives.\",\n",

However, although bacteria have been shown to be susceptible to phage therapy, phage therapy is not sufficient in some cases. PhiMR003 is a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus phage previously isolated from sewage influent, and it has demonstrated high lytic activity and a broad host range to MRSA clinical isolates in vitro. To investigate the potential of phiMR003 for the treatment of MRSA infection, the effects of phiMR003 on immune responses in vivo were analysed using phiMR003-susceptible MRSA strains in a mouse wound infection model. Additionally, we assessed whether phiMR003 could affect the immune response to infection with a nonsusceptible MRSA strain. Interestingly, wounds infected with both susceptible and nonsusceptible MRSA strains treated with phiMR003 demonstrated decreased bacterial load, reduced inflammation and accelerated wound closure. Moreover, the infiltration of inflammatory cells in infected tissue was altered by phiMR003. While the effects of phiMR003 on inflammation and bacterial load disappeared with heat inactivation of phiMR003. Transcripts of proinflammatory cytokines induced by lipopolysaccharide were reduced in mouse peritoneal macrophages. These results show that the immune modulation occurring as a response to the phage itself improves the clinical outcomes of phage therapy.\",\n",

The synthetic STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes protein) agonist is a new class of drugs currently being evaluated in clinical trials as a potential anticancer therapy. In this study, we used ML00960317 (synthetic STING agonist) to investigate the hepatobiliary disposition of this novel molecular entity. A bile-duct cannulated (BDC) rat study indicated that biliary excretion is the major route of elimination for ML00960317 (84% of parent dose in bile). The human biliary clearance using in vitro sandwich cultured human hepatocyte model predicted significant biliary excretion of ML00960317 (biliary excretion index (BEI) of 47%). Moreover, the transport studies using transporter expressing cell lines, hepatocytes, and membrane vesicles indicated that ML00960317 is a robust substrate of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and MRP2. Using relative expression factor approach, the combined contribution of OATP1B1 (fraction transported (f\",\n",

Moreover, WEE2-AS1 is markedly higher in plasma sEVs of CRC patients than in healthy subjects and its high level predicts advanced pathological staging and poor survival.

The rat caudal disc has been used in disc degeneration studies because of its low cost and simplicity. However, no consensus on the size of the needle to be used during this process has been reached, yet.\\nThis study aims to select an optimal needle size to establish a reproducible IVD degeneration model.\\nThis is a randomized, experimental trial.\\nCell therapy and experimental surgery of musculoskeletal system LR18SP1 Lab, The Faculty of Medicine of Sfax, Tunisia.\\nThe validity was verified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histological, and immunohistochemical examinations.\\nThe MRI, histological, and immunohistochemical examinations showed that a disc that is perforated with a 21G needle degenerated acutely one week after the surgery, while a 29G needle puncture failed to develop disc degeneration. A 25G needle induced progressive degeneration in the IVD.\\nThis study was not very long (6 weeks).\\nWe conclude that the size of the needle affects the onset and the progression of disc degeneration; a larger needle size leads to a more extended histological and radiographic degeneration within the IVD and in a relatively short time. Therefore, a 21G needle is an optimal choice to induce rapid degeneration in rats' caudal discs. However, the use of a 29G needle failed to establish a degenerative IVD model, which makes it ideal for IVD injection of drugs, plasmids, and growth factors. A 25G needle may be used to induce gradual degeneration.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Influenza A virus (IAV) infection causes acute respiratory disease with potential severe and deadly complications. Viral pathogenesis is not only due to the direct cytopathic effect of viral infections but also to the exacerbated host inflammatory responses. Influenza viral infection can activate various host signaling pathways that function to activate or inhibit viral replication. Our previous studies have shown that a receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA plays an important role in the replication of influenza viruses in vitro, but its biological roles and functional mechanisms in influenza viral infection have not been characterized. Here we show that IAV infection strongly activates TrkA in vitro and in vivo. Using a chemical-genetic approach to specifically control TrkA kinase activity through a small molecule compound 1NMPP1 in a TrkA knock-in (TrkA KI) mouse model, we show that 1NMPP1-mediated TrkA inhibition completely protected mice from a lethal IAV infection by significantly reducing viral loads and lung inflammation. Using primary lung cells isolated from the TrkA KI mice, we show that specific TrkA inhibition reduced IAV viral RNA synthesis in airway epithelial cells (AECs) but not in alveolar macrophages (AMs). Transcriptomic analysis confirmed the cell-type-specific role of TrkA in viral RNA synthesis, and identified distinct gene expression patterns under the TrkA regulation in IAV-infected AECs and AMs. Among the TrkA-activated targets are various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL6, IL-1\\u03b2, IFNs, CCL-5, and CXCL9, supporting the role of TrkA in mediating lung inflammation. Indeed, while TrkA inhibitor 1NMPP1 administered after the peak of IAV replication had no effect on viral load, it was able to decrease lung inflammation and provided partial protection in mice. Taken together, our results have demonstrated for the first time an important biological role of TrkA signaling in IAV infection, identified its cell-type-specific contribution to viral replication, and revealed its functional mechanism in virus-induced lung inflammation. This study suggests TrkA as a novel host target for therapeutic development against influenza viral disease.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The genome of cowpoxvirus (CPXV) could be considered prototypical for orthopoxviridae (OXPV) since it contains many open reading frames (ORFs) absent or lost in other OPXV, including vaccinia virus (VACV). These additional ORFs are non-essential for growth in vitro but are expected to contribute to the broad host range, virulence and immune evasion characteristics of CPXV. For instance, unlike VACV, CPXV encodes proteins that interfere with T cell stimulation, either directly or by preventing antigen presentation or co-stimulation. When studying the priming of na\\u00efve T cells, we discovered that CPXV, but not VACV, encodes a secreted factor that interferes with activation and proliferation of na\\u00efve CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively, in response to anti-CD3 antibodies, but not to other stimuli. Deletion mapping revealed that the inhibitory protein is encoded by CPXV14, a small secreted glycoprotein belonging to the poxvirus immune evasion (PIE) family and containing a smallpoxvirus encoded chemokine receptor (SECRET) domain that mediates binding to chemokines. We demonstrate that CPXV14 inhibition of antibody-mediated T cell activation depends on the presence of Fc-gamma receptors (Fc\\u03b3Rs) on bystander cells. In vitro, CPXV14 inhibits Fc\\u03b3R-activation by antigen/antibody complexes by binding to Fc\\u03b3Rs with high affinity and immobilized CPXV14 can trigger signaling through Fc\\u03b3Rs, particularly the inhibitory Fc\\u03b3RIIB. In vivo, CPXV14-deleted virus showed reduced viremia and virulence resulting in reduced weight loss and death compared to wildtype virus whereas both antibody and CD8+ T cell responses were increased in the absence of CPXV14. Furthermore, no impact of CPXV14-deletion on virulence was observed in mice lacking the inhibitory Fc\\u03b3RIIB. Taken together our results suggest that CPXV14 contributes to virulence and immune evasion by binding to host Fc\\u03b3Rs.\",\n",

Osteoanabolic drugs have the potential to augment the repair of fractures but have constraints like high costs or undesirable side effects. The bone healing potential of a drug can initially be determined by in vitro studies, but in vivo studies are needed for the final proof of concept. Our objective was to develop a femur osteotomy rodent model that could help researchers understand the development of callus formation following fracture of the shaft of the femur and that could help establish whether a potential drug has bone healing properties. Adult male Wistar albino rats were used after Institutional Animal Ethics Committee clearance. The rodents were anesthetized, and under aseptic conditions, complete transverse fractures at the middle one-third of the shafts of the femurs were created using open osteotomy. The fractures were reduced and internally fixed using intramedullary K-wires, and secondary fracture healing was allowed to take place. After surgery, intraperitoneal analgesics and antibiotics were given for 5 days. Sequential weekly x-rays assessed callus formation. The rats were sacrificed based on radiologically pre-determined time points, and the development of the fracture callus was analyzed radiologically and using immunohistochemistry.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"During the last decade, optogenetics has become an essential tool for the investigation of neural signaling due to its unique capability of selective neural modulation or monitoring. As specific types of neuronal cells can be genetically modified to express opsin proteins, optogenetics enables optical stimulation or inhibition of the selected neurons. There have been several technological advances in the optical system for optogenetics. Recently, it was proposed to combine the optical waveguide for light delivery with electrophysiological recording to simultaneously monitor the neural responses to optogenetic stimulation or inhibition. In this study, an implantable optrode array (2x2 optical fibers) was developed with embedded multichannel electrodes. A light-emitting diode (LED) was employed as a light source, and a microfabricated microlens array was integrated to provide sufficient light power at the tip of the optical fibers. The optrode array system comprises the disposable part and the reusable part. The disposable part has optical fibers and electrodes, while the reusable part has the LED and electronic circuitry for light control and neural signal processing. The novel design of the implantable optrode array system is introduced in the accompanying video in addition to the procedure of the optrode implantation surgery, optogenetic light stimulation, and the electrophysiological neural recording. The results of in vivo experiments successfully showed time-locked neural spikes evoked by the light stimuli from hippocampal excitatory neurons of mice.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The anti-cocaine monoclonal antibody, h2E2, is a candidate for treating cocaine-use disorder. h2E2 binds to and sequesters cocaine in the plasma compartment, effectively decreasing cocaine concentrations in the brains of rats and mice. Despite the binding of cocaine to h2E2, plasma cocaine concentrations decline rapidly in rodents over time, but there was a drastic decrease in the urinary elimination of cocaine in the presence of h2E2. Since cocaine is not being renally excreted, the apparent disappearance of cocaine from the plasma must be explained by either metabolism or distribution. However, binding of cocaine to h2E2 may restrict the availability of cocaine for hydrolysis by endogenous esterases. Therefore, the antibody would be expected to extend the elimination half-life of cocaine. In contrast, previous studies reported h2E2 as having no effect on the rate of cocaine clearance. It is important to examine the ultimate clearance of the cocaine to ascertain its half-life and potential for re-intoxication. Therefore, we investigated the effects of h2E2 on cocaine hydrolysis in vitro and on cocaine metabolism and disposition in vivo over a 6-h time course. The spontaneous and enzyme-mediated in vitro hydrolysis of cocaine was drastically decreased in the presence of h2E2 in vitro. Additionally, in mice, h2E2 significantly increased the distribution and elimination half-lives of cocaine relative to vehicle controls over an extended time course. Therefore, we concluded that h2E2 slowing the distribution and elimination of cocaine is the most appropriate explanation for the initial disappearance of cocaine from the plasma in vivo.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"It has been reported that ischemia and ischemic preconditioning (IPC) have different effects on the expression of tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1), which may contribute to the tolerance to ischemia/hypoxia with the increase of autophagy. The mechanisms of TSC1 differential expression are still unclear under ischemia/IPC conditions in hippocampal Cornu Ammon 1 (CA1) and Cornu Ammon 3 (CA3) area neuronal cells. While we have shown that 5-Aza-CdR, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, can upregulate TSC1 and increase hypoxic tolerance by autophagy in vivo and in vitro, in this study, we examined whether DNA methylation was involved in the differential expression of TSC1 in the CA1 and CA3 regions induced by hypoxic preconditioning (HPC).\\nLevel of rapamycin (mTOR) autophagy, a downstream molecular pathway of TSC1/TSC2 complex, was detected in HPC mouse hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas as well as in the HPC model of mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. DNA methylation level of TSC1 promoter (-720\\u2009bp~\\u2009-360\\u2009bp) was determined in CA1 and CA3 areas by bisulfite-modified DNA sequencing (BMDS). At the same time, autophagy was detected in HT22 cells transfected with GFP-LC3 plasmid. The role of TSC1 in neuroprotection was measured by cell viability and apoptosis, and the role of TSC1 in metabolism was checked by ATP assay and ROS assay in HT22 cells that overexpressed/knocked down TSC1.\\nHPC upregulated the expression of TSC1, downregulated the level of P-mTOR (Ser2448) and P-p70S6K (Thr389), and enhanced the activity of autophagy in both in vivo and in vitro. The increased expression of TSC1 in HPC may depend on its DNA hypomethylation in the promoter region in vivo. HPC also could reduce energy consumption in HT22 cells. Overexpression and knockdown of TSC1 can affect cell viability, cell apoptosis, and metabolism in HT22 cells exposed to hypoxia.\\nTSC1 expression induced by HPC may relate to the downregulation of its DNA methylation level with the increase of autophagy and the decrease of energy demand.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Doxorubicin (DOX), the anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent, is widely used for the treatment of various cancers. However, its clinical application is compromised by dose-dependent and fatal cardiotoxicity. This study is aimed at investigating the cardioprotective effects of Qishen granule (QSG) and the specific mechanism by which QSG alleviates DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) and providing an alternative for the treatment of DIC. We first evaluated the cardioprotective effects of QSG in a DIC mouse model, and the obtained results showed that QSG significantly protected against DOX-induced myocardial structural and functional damage, mitochondrial oxidative damage, and apoptosis. Subsequently, after a comprehensive understanding of the specific roles and recent developments of p53-mediated mitochondrial quality control mechanisms in DIC, we investigated whether QSG acted on MDM2 to regulate the activity of p53 and downstream mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. The in vivo results showed that DOX inhibited mitochondrial biogenesis and blocked mitophagy in the mouse myocardium, while QSG reversed these effects. Mechanistically, we combined nutlin-3, which inhibits the binding of p53 and MDM2, with DOX and QSG and evaluated their influence on mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. The obtained results showed that both DOX and nutlin-3 substantially inhibited mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis and induced mitochondrial oxidative damage and apoptosis, which could be partially recovered by QSG. Importantly, the immunoprecipitation results showed that QSG promoted the binding of MDM2 to p53, thus decreasing the level of p53 protein and the binding of p53 to Parkin. Collectively, QSG could promote the degradation of p53 by enhancing the binding of MDM2 to the p53 protein, resulting in the reduced binding of p53 to the Parkin protein, thus improving Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Increased degradation of p53 protein by QSG simultaneously enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis mediated by PGC-1\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In the development of many tumors, IPO5, as a member of the nuclear transporter family, exerts a significant function. Also, IPO5 is used as a therapeutic target for tumors based on some reports. By studying IPO5 expression in esophageal cancer tissues, the mechanism associated with IPO5 improving esophageal cancer development was explored in this study.\\nTo gain differentially expressed genes, this study utilized mRNA microarray and TCGA database for comprehensive analysis of esophageal cancer tissues and normal esophageal cancer tissues, and then the differentially expressed gene IPO5 was screened by us. To assess esophageal cancer patients' prognosis, this study also applied the Kaplan-Meier analysis, and we also conducted the GSEA enrichment analysis to investigate IPO5-related signaling pathways. This study performed TISIDB and TIMER online analysis tools to study the correlation between IPO5 and immune regulation and infiltration. We took specimens of esophageal cancer from patients and detected the expression of IPO5 in tumor and normal tissues by immunohistochemistry. The IPO5 gene-silenced esophageal cancer cell model was constructed by lentivirus transfection. Through the Transwell invasion assay, CCK-8 assay, and cell scratch assay, this study investigated the effects of IPO5 on cell propagation, invasion, and transfer. What is more, we identified the influences of IPO5 on the cell cycle through flow cytometry and established a subcutaneous tumor-forming model in nude mice. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify the expression of KI-67, and this study detected the modifications of cell pathway-related proteins using Western blot and applied EMT-related proteins to explain the mechanism of esophageal cancer induced by IPO5.\\nAccording to database survival analysis, IPO5 high-expression patients had shorter disease-free survival than IPO5 low-expression patients. Compared to normal tissues, the IPO5 expression in cancer tissues was significantly higher in clinical trials (\\nIn esophageal cancer, IPO5 is highly expressed and correlates with survival rate. Esophageal cancer cell growth and migration were significantly affected by the inhibition of IPO5 in vitro and in vivo. IPO5 mediates EMT using the RAS-ERK signaling pathway activation and promotes esophageal cancer cell development in vivo and in vitro.\",\n",

In particular, multiple newly reported cases of autoimmune-related diseases after COVID-19 require further research on coronavirus-related immune injury. However, owing to the strong infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and the high mortality rate, it is difficult to perform relevant research in humans. Here, we reviewed animal models, specifically mice with coronavirus-related immune disorders and immune damage, considering aspects of coronavirus replacement, viral modification, spike protein, and gene fragments. The evaluation of mouse models of coronavirus-related immune injury may help establish a standardised animal model that could be employed in various areas of research, such as disease occurrence and development processes, vaccine effectiveness assessment, and treatments for coronavirus-related immune disorders. COVID-19 is a complex disease and animal models cannot comprehensively summarise the disease process. The application of genetic technology may change this status.\",\n",

Targeting microglia/macrophage-based neuroinflammation presents a promising therapeutic strategy.

In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of FA against hypoxia-induced retinal angiogenesis using cultured retinal vascular endothelial cells and an oxygen-induced retinopathy mouse (OIR) model. The immunoregulatory effect of FA on microglia/macrophage polarization was evaluated by detecting the expression of specific markers for both pro-inflammatory \\\"M1\\\" and anti-inflammatory \\\"M2\\\" phenotypes using co-immunostaining and polymerase chain reaction assays. The underlying molecular mechanism upon FA treatment was also explored. The results showed that FA supplement markedly inhibited retinal pathological angiogenesis both \",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In vivo angiotensin II (AngII)-treatment is a widely used experimental model to induce cardiovascular disease and results in a high likelihood of abdominal aorta aneurysm (AAA) formation. This involves progressive and irreversible focal dilation of the abdominal aorta and induces adverse aortic connective tissue remodeling contributing to aortic wall stiffening through inflammation, elastin degradation, and collagen restructuring. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate how AAA formation in AngII-treated mice affects aortic function and biomechanics. To this end, C57Bl/6J mice were treated with AngII (1000\\u2009ng/[kg.min]) or PBS infusion for 28\\u2009days. Peripheral blood pressure, echocardiography, and aortic pulse wave velocity were measured in vivo. Thoracic aorta rings were studied ex vivo in organ chambers, while aortic vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype was investigated histologically. We confirmed peripheral hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, aortic stiffening, and increased VSMC proliferation and migration after AngII-treatment. Abdominal aorta aneurysm formation was observed in 8/13 AngII-treated mice. Ex vivo thoracic aortic rings of both aneurysmal and non-aneurysmal AngII-treated mice showed high isobaric aortic stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, heightened \\u03b1\",\n",

Theanine is a unique amino acid found in green tea and could confer beneficial effects on cell protection. This study investigates if protective effect on the liver by stem cells preincubated with theanine is better than that from stem cells without preincubated theanine.\\nWe transplanted theanine preincubated adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) to male Wistar rats with liver dysfunction induced by N-nitrosodiethylamine. The viability, migration and antioxidant capabilities were performed in the ADSC pre-incubated with theanine. Hepatic functional, structural and molecular assays were determined in the animals with or without theanine preincubated ADSC.\\nCell model revealed that ADSC preincubated with green tea theanine (T-ADSC) increased cell capabilities including viability, migration and paracrine secretion. In vivo results indicated that several pathological conditions were observed in rats with liver injury induced by DEN including structural changes and expression of pyroptosis as well as autophagy markers. The above pathological conditions were improved when the rats received both ADSC and T-ADSC treatment. Furthermore, T-ADSC showed better therapeutic effect on rats with liver injury than ADSC due to significant suppression of pyroptosis markers caspase-1 and IL-1\\u03b2 as well as autophagy marker LC3-II accompanied with intensive paracrine VEGF from T-ADSC.\\nIncreased paracrine VEGF secretion from T-ADSC plays a crucial role in liver regeneration. A future clinical study may be designed for further verification of these experimental in vivo findings.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is increasingly recognized as a global public health issue. Diabetic nephropathy (DN), also known as diabetic kidney disease, is a leading cause of CKD. Regenerative medicine strategy employing nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) is worthy of consideration as an alternative to shortage of donor organs for kidney transplantation. In previous study, we successfully generated induced NPCs (iNPCs) from human urine-derived cells that resembled human embryonic stem cell-derived NPCs. Here, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of iNPCs in DN animal model. The results revealed the therapeutic effect of iNPCs as follows: (1) diminished glomerular hypertrophy, (2) reduced tubulointerstitial fibrosis, (3) low blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and albuminuria value, (4) decreased inflammation/fibrosis, (5) enhanced renal regeneration and (6) confirmed safety. This study demonstrates that human iNPCs have a therapeutic potential as a cell source for transplantation in patients with kidney diseases.\",\n",

Here we report the reprogramming of human fibroblasts to produce chemically-induced osteogenic cells (ciOG), and explore the potential uses of ciOG in bone repair and disease treatment. A chemical cocktail of RepSox, forskolin, and phenamil was used for osteogenic induction of fibroblasts by activation of RUNX2 expression. Following a maturation, the cells differentiated toward an osteoblast phenotype that produced mineralized nodules. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing identified a distinct ciOG population. ciOG formed mineralized tissue in an ectopic site of immunodeficiency mice, unlike the original fibroblasts. Osteogenic reprogramming was modulated under engineered culture substrates. When generated on a nanofiber substrate ciOG accelerated bone matrix formation in a calvarial defect, indicating that the engineered biomaterial promotes the osteogenic capacity of ciOG in vivo. Furthermore, the ciOG platform recapitulated the genetic bone diseases Proteus syndrome and osteogenesis imperfecta, allowing candidate drug testing. The reprogramming of human fibroblasts into osteogenic cells with a chemical cocktail thus provides a source of specialized cells for use in bone tissue engineering and disease modeling.\",\n",

Specifically, chronically activated microglia and their disturbed regulatory system contribute to retinal degeneration. Galectin-3, a \\u03b2-galactose binding protein, is a potent driver of macrophage and microglia activation and has been implicated in neuroinflammation, including neurodegenerative diseases of the brain. Here, we hypothesized that genetic deficiency of galectin-3 or its modulation via TD139 dampens mononuclear phagocyte reactivity and delays retinal degeneration.\\nGalectin-3 expression in AMD patients was analyzed by immunohistochemical stainings. Galectin-3 knockout and BALB/cJ mice were exposed to white bright light with an intensity of 15,000\\u00a0lux for 1\\u00a0h and Cx3cr1\\nWe found that galectin-3 expression was strongly upregulated in reactive retinal mononuclear phagocytes of AMD patients and in the two related mouse models of light-induced retinal degeneration. The experimental in vivo data further showed that specific targeting of galectin-3 by genetic knockout or administration of the small-molecule inhibitor TD139 reduced microglia reactivity and delayed retinal damage in both light damage conditions.\\nThis study defines galectin-3 as a potent driver of retinal degeneration and highlights the protein as a drug target for ocular immunomodulatory therapies.\",\n",

The in vitro anti-asthma effects in cells were confirmed in mice following the induction of asthma by alumina and chicken egg ovalbumin (OVA). Oral administration of the bioprocessed Ecklonia cava and purified fractions suppressed the induction of asthma and was accompanied by the inhibition of inflammation- and immune-related substances, including eotaxin; thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP); OVA-specific IgE; leukotriene C\\nThe in vitro cell and in vivo mouse assays demonstrate the potential value of the new bioprocessed formulation as an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic combination of natural compounds against allergic asthma and might also ameliorate allergic manifestations of foods, drugs, and viral infections.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The recently emerged Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has rapidly surpassed Delta to become the predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant, given the higher transmissibility rate and immune escape ability, resulting in breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. A new generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines targeting the Omicron variant are urgently needed. Here, we developed a subunit vaccine named RBD-HR/trimer by directly linking the sequence of RBD derived from the Delta variant (containing L452R and T478K) and HR1 and HR2 in SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit in a tandem manner, which can self-assemble into a trimer. In multiple animal models, vaccination of RBD-HR/trimer formulated with MF59-like oil-in-water adjuvant elicited sustained humoral immune response with high levels of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies against Omicron variants, also inducing a strong T cell immune response in vivo. In addition, our RBD-HR/trimer vaccine showed a strong boosting effect against Omicron variants after two doses of mRNA vaccines, featuring its capacity to be used in a prime-boost regimen. In mice and non-human primates, RBD-HR/trimer vaccination could confer a complete protection against live virus challenge of Omicron and Delta variants. The results qualified RBD-HR/trimer vaccine as a promising next-generation vaccine candidate for prevention of SARS-CoV-2, which deserved further evaluation in clinical trials.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"ABCA3 (ATP-binding cassette class A3) is a transmembrane transporter that plays a positive role in chronic pulmonary inflammation by regulating lipid metabolism. However, it is not completely clear whether ABCA3 and its signaling factors are involved in chronic pulmonary inflammation induced by the combination of CSE (cigarette smoke extract) and LPS (lipopolysaccharide). In this study, we used the method of combining CSE and LPS which was widely used to study lung inflammation-related diseases and has been proven effective in our group's studies to create in vivo and in vitro pulmonary inflammation models. The result showed that, after CSE in combination with LPS treatment, ABCA3 expression was downregulated in rat lung in vivo and in a human alveolar cell line in vitro. ABCA3 expression was upregulated, and related inflammatory factors were downregulated in the state of overexpression of PPAR\\u03b3 or inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway, while PPAR\\u03b3 deletion or MAPK14 overexpression showed the opposite results. The level of PPAR\\u03b3 remained unchanged, and the expression of ABCA3 was upregulated in the state of the p38 MAPK pathway was inhibited under overexpression of PPAR\\u03b3. These results indicate that CSE combined with LPS can result in downregulation of ABCA3 under conditions of inflammation, and that the p38 MAPK signaling pathway mediated by PPAR\\u03b3 can regulate the expression changes of ABCA3, thus providing new targets for treating chronic pulmonary inflammation.\",\n",

Thus far, we have reported red and blue-green versions of DiFC. Use of near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent light would in principle allow use of DiFC in deeper tissues and would be compatible with emerging NIR fluorescence molecular contrast agents.AimWe describe the design of a NIR-DiFC instrument and demonstrate its use in optical flow phantoms in vitro and in mice in vivo.ApproachWe developed an improved optical fiber probe design for efficient collection of fluorescence from individual circulating cells and efficient rejection of instrument autofluorescence. We built a NIR-DiFC instrument. We tested this with NIR fluorescent microspheres and cell lines labeled with OTL38 fluorescence contrast agent in a flow phantom model. We also tested NIR-DiFC in nude mice injected intravenously with OTL38-labeled L1210A cells.ResultsNIR-DiFC allowed detection of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in flow phantoms with mean signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 19 to 32\\u00a0dB. In mice, fluorescently labeled CTCs were detectable with mean SNR of 26\\u00a0dB. NIR-DiFC also exhibited orders significantly lower autofluorescence and false-alarm rates than blue-green DiFC.ConclusionsNIR-DiFC allows use of emerging NIR contrast agents. Our work could pave the way for future use of NIR-DiFC in humans.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (HPH) is a common complication of chronic lung disease, which severely affects the survival and prognosis of patients. Several recent reports have shown that DNA damage and repair plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension. DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) as a part of DNA-PK is a molecular sensor for DNA damage that enhances DSB repair. This study aimed to demonstrate the expression and potential mechanism of DNA-PKcs on the pathogenesis of HPH.\\nLevels of DNA-PKcs and other proteins in explants of human and rats pulmonary artery from lung tissues and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) were measured by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. The mRNA expression levels of DNA-PKcs and NOR1 in PASMCs were quantified with qRT-PCR. Meanwhile, the interaction among proteins were detected by Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays. Cell proliferation and apoptosis was assessed by cell counting kit-8 assay(CCK-8), EdU incorporation and flow cytometry. Rat models of HPH were constructed to verify the role of DNA-PKcs in pulmonary vascular remodeling in vivo.\\nDNA-PKcs protein levels were both significantly up-regulated in explants of pulmonary artery from HPH models and lung tissues of patients with hypoxemia. In human PASMCs, hypoxia up-regulated DNA-PKcs in a time-dependent manner. Downregulation of DNA-PKcs by targeted siRNA or small-molecule inhibitor NU7026 both induced cell proliferation inhibition and cell cycle arrest. DNA-PKcs affected proliferation by regulating NOR1 protein synthesis followed by the expression of cyclin D1. Co-immunoprecipitation of NOR1 with DNA-PKcs was severely increased in hypoxia. Meanwhile, hypoxia promoted G\\nOur study indicated the potential mechanism of DNA-PKcs in the development of HPH. It might provide insights into new therapeutic targets for pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R)-associated idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) is a common immune-related disease in adults. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) is the key mediator of angiogenesis, which leads to numerous kidney diseases. However, the role of VEGFA in IMN is poorly understood.\\nIn the present study, we downloaded the microarray data GSE115857 from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with R software. The cytoHubba plug-in were used to identify hub genes from the protein-protein interaction network. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify signalling pathway in IMN. CCK8 was performed to assess the cell viability in human vascular endothelial cells (HVECs). Then, passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) was induced in rats by a single tail vein injection of anti-Fx1A antiserum. Animals treated with VEGFA inhibitor bevacizumab (BV), with saline as a positive control. Proteinuria was evaluated by biochemical measurements. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence was used to evaluate relative proteins expression. Electron microscopy was performed to observe the thickness of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM).\\nWe revealed 3 hub genes, including one up-regulated gene VEGFA and two down-regulated genes JUN and FOS, which are closely related to the development of PLA2R-associated IMN. Pathway enrichment analysis found that the biological process induced by VEGFA is associated with PI3K/Akt signalling. GSEA showed that the signalling pathway of DEGs in GSE115857 was focused on angiogenesis, in which VEGFA acts as a core gene. We confirmed the high expression of VEGFA, PI3K, and AKT in IMN renal biopsy samples with immunohistochemistry. In HVECs, we found that BV suppresses cell viability in a time and dose dependent manner. In vivo, we found low dose of BV attenuates proteinuria via inhibiting VEGFA/PI3K/AKT signalling. Meanwhile, low dose of BV alleviates the thickening of the GBM.\\nVEGFA/PI3K/AKT signalling may play significant roles in the pathogenesis of IMN, which may provide new targets for the treatment of IMN.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Hot melt extrusion (HME) has been used for the formulation of topical solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) gel without using any other size reduction technique including high pressure homogenization or sonication. SLN formulation solely using HME has not been applied to other drugs except IBU. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to formulate FLB SLN solely using HME technique and evaluate the SLN formulation in inflammation animal model. Stable 0.5%\\u00a0w/v FLB SLN gel with particle size\\u2009<\\u2009250\\u00a0nm, PI\\u2009<\\u20090.3 and EE of\\u2009>\\u200998% was prepared. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram showed that the drug was converted to amorphous form in the HME process. Additionally, rheological studies demonstrated that FLB SLN gel and marketed FLB gel showed shear thinning property. FLB SLN formulation showed significantly (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) higher peak force required to spread the formulation as compared to marketed FLB formulation. Stability studies showed that FLB SLN gel was stable for a month at room temperature and 2-4\\u00b0C. Moreover, in vitro permeation test (IVPT) and ex vivo skin deposition study results revealed that FLB SLN gel showed significant (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) increase in drug deposition in dermal layer and drug permeation as compared to control marketed formulation. Further, in vivo anti-inflammatory study showed equivalent inhibition of rat paw edema using 0.5% w/v FLB SLN gel which has 10 times less strength compared to control formulation. Overall, FLB SLN formulation was successfully manufactured solely using HME technique which resulted in enhanced the skin permeation of FLB and superior anti-inflammatory activity.\",\n",

Primary infection of pregnant women is associated with a high risk of hydrops fetalis and stillbirth due to severe fetal anemia. Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidates for B19 have been developed, although none have been approved so far. The B19 phospholipase A2 domain (B19 PLA2), located in the VP1 unique region, is believed to be associated with adverse inflammatory reactions, and previous effective attempts to improve this vaccine modality inserted a mutation to impair the PLA2 activity of VLPs. In this study, we designed VLPs with a deletion mutant of PLA2 (\\u22bfPLA2 B19 VLP), devoid of PLA2 activity, and confirmed their immunogenicity and safe use in vivo. These results were supported by the lack of histological inflammatory reactions at the site of immunization or the production of IL-6 in \\u22bfPLA2 B19 VLP-immunized mice, that were observed in mice immunized with B19 VLPs.

Our aim was to characterize the vasoactivity of Rhinella marina poison (RmP) on the aorta of male Wistar rats. For this, the RmP was first collected and processed to obtain an alcoholic extract. To determine cardiovascular effects of RmP, we performed in vivo tests by administering RmP intravenously in doses of 0.1-0.8\\u00a0mg/kg. Vascular reactivity was also performed through concentration-response curves to RmP (10\\u00a0ng/mL to 200\\u00a0\\u03bcg/mL) in aortic segments with and without endothelium. RmP induced a concentration-dependent contraction in rat aorta which was partly endothelium-mediated. Nitric oxide contributes with this response in view that incubation with L-NAME increased the contractile response. Additionally, treatment with indomethacin [cyclooxygenase, (COX) inhibitor], nifedipine (L-type voltage-gated calcium channels blocker), and BQ-123 (ET\",\n",

A pressure injury (PI) is a treatable but serious and costly disease with adverse outcomes for the patient. However, traditional PI treatments are time-consuming, with limited effectiveness. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of PRF on skin wound healing in PIs in vivo in a rat model.\\nPRF was prepared from the blood of male Wistar rats. A rat model for PI ischaemia/reperfusion injury was established by placing a magnet onto the back skin, where a magnetic steel plate had been previously implanted. The rats were randomised into two groups: the control group was treated with sterile gauze dressings and the iPRF group received additional PRF. Skin wound healing rate was calculated and a CD31/Masson's trichrome stain performed.\\nIn this study, 16 rats were allocated to the two groups (n=8 in each group). PRF improved the skin wound healing rate of PIs in the rats; haematoxylin and eosin staining and CD31 staining showed that the number of capillaries increased significantly in the wound. However, Masson's trichrome staining showed no increase in fibrotic tissues after PRF treatment.\\nIn this in vivo rat model for PI, PRF accelerated skin wound healing by increasing angiogenesis in the wound.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"As a representative of tumor immunotherapy, tumor vaccine can inhibit tumor growth by activating tumor-specific immune response, which has the advantages of relatively low toxicity and high efficiency, and has attracted much attention in recent years. However, there are still difficulties in how to effectively deliver tumor vaccines in vivo and make them work efficiently. It is a relatively mature method to load tumor specific antigens with suitable carriers to produce tumor vaccines. Here, a generally minimalist construction method of tumor nanovaccine was developed. A high-efficiency tumor nanovaccine (NV) was prepared in one step by a biomineralization-like method, which contained ovalbumin (OVA, model antigen), unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG, adjuvant) and Mn-NP (carrier and adjuvant). NV not only showed good tumor preventive effect, but also could successfully inhibited tumor development and metastasis when combined with anti-PD-L1, and induced long-term immune memory effect. However, the method of screening tumor specific antigen to construct nanovaccine is cumbersome and tumors are heterogeneous. Therefore, surgically resected tumor tissue is the best source of antigens for preparing tumor vaccines. Next, based on the strong loading ability of the carrier, we designed a personalized tumor nanovaccine (PNV) using the supernatant of tumor abrasive fluid (STAF) as antigen based on the generally minimalist tumor nanovaccine construction strategy. PNV combined with anti-PD-L1 could successfully inhibit post-surgical tumor recurrence and induce strong and durable immune memory effects. This study presents a novel, general, and minimalist strategy to construct high-efficiency personalized nanovaccine, which has a wide range of potential applications in the field of tumor treatment.\",\n",

Whereas, there is no in-depth research of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) analysis of ARSC after intragastric administration in rats with CI/RI.\\nThe purpose of this research is to investigate the PK characteristics of eight active ingredients (astragaloside IV, calycosin, calycosin-7-O-\\u03b2-glucoside, formononetin, ononin, hydroxysafflor yellow A, syringin and vernine) of ARSC, and the regulation of neurotransmitters disorders, revealing the pharmacodynamic substance basis and the mechanism of ARSC in treating CI/RI from the molecular level.\\nWe established a new method which based on blood-brain dual channel microdialysis (MD) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to continuously gather, and determine the components of ARSC and neurotransmitters related to CI/RI in vivo. The collected data were analyzed by sigmoid-E\\nThe validated LC-MS/MS method had specificity and selectivity to simultaneously analyze the concentration of eight active components of ARSC extract and five neurotransmitters of CI/RI rats. The recovery rates of brain MD probe and blood MD probe were stable within six hours. The MD probes recovery rates decreased with the increase of flow rates, but the solution concentration had little effect on the probes recovery rates.\\u00a0It was feasible to correct the recovery rates of probes in vivo by using reverse dialysis method.\\u00a0All eight active ingredients of ARSC could pass across the blood brain barrier after CI/RI. ARSC regulated the release of glutamate (Glu), \\u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine (DA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and aspartic acid (Asp). Notably, astragaloside IV and hydroxysafflor yellow A might have better regulatory effect on neurotransmitters in comparison with other six measured components of ARSC, and Glu was the neurotransmitter mainly regulated in CI/RI rats.\\nThe ARSC was able to treat CI/RI through ameliorating neurotransmitters disorders. There was a hysteresis between the peaked drug concentration and maximum therapeutic effect of ARSC. The drug effective concentrations range of ASIV, calycosin, calycosin-7-O-\\u03b2-glucoside, syringin and vernine in blood microdialysate and calycosin, syringin, vernine in brain microdialysate were narrow, which need be paid attention in clinical use.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Assessing the efficacy of cancer therapeutics in mouse models is a critical step in treatment development. However, low-resolution measurement tools and small sample sizes make determining drug efficacy in vivo a difficult and time-intensive task. Here, we present a commercially scalable wearable electronic strain sensor that automates the in vivo testing of cancer therapeutics by continuously monitoring the micrometer-scale progression or regression of subcutaneously implanted tumors at the minute time scale. In two in vivo cancer mouse models, our sensor discerned differences in tumor volume dynamics between drug- and vehicle-treated tumors within 5 hours following therapy initiation. These short-term regression measurements were validated through histology, and caliper and bioluminescence measurements taken over weeklong treatment periods demonstrated the correlation with longer-term treatment response. We anticipate that real-time tumor regression datasets could help expedite and automate the process of screening cancer therapies in vivo.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Intercellular mitochondria transfer is a biological phenomenon implicated in diverse biological processes. However, the physiological role of this phenomenon remains understudied between erythroblasts and their erythroblastic island (EBI) macrophage niche. To gain further insights into the mitochondria transfer functions, we infused EBI macrophages in vivo into mice subjected to different modes of anemic stresses. Interestingly, we observed the occurrence of mitochondria transfer events from the infused EBI macrophages to early stages of erythroblasts coupled with enhanced erythroid recovery. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis on erythroblasts receiving exogenous mitochondria revealed a subset of highly proliferative and metabolically active erythroid populations marked by high expression of CD47. Furthermore, CD47 or Sirp\\u03b1 blockade leads to a decline in both the occurrence of mitochondria transfer events and their mediated erythroid recovery. Hence, these data indicate a significant role of mitochondria transfer in the enhancement of erythroid recovery from stress through the alteration of the bioenergetic profiles via CD47-Sirp\\u03b1 interaction in the early stages of erythroblasts.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are attractive candidates for treating hepatic disorders given their potential to enhance liver regeneration and function. The paracrine paradigm may be involved in the mechanism of MSC-based therapy, and exosomes (Exo) play an important role in this paracrine activity. Hypoxia significantly improves the effectiveness of MSC transplantation. However, whether hypoxia preconditioned MSCs (Hp-MSCs) can enhance liver regeneration, and whether this enhancement is mediated by Exo, are unknown. In this study, mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) and secreted Exo were injected through the tail vein. We report that Hp-MSCs promote liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy in mice through their secreted exosomes. Interestingly, MSC-Exo were concentrated in liver 6\\u00a0h after administration and mainly taken up by macrophages, but not hepatocytes. Compared with normoxic MSC-Exo (N-Exo), hypoxic MSC-Exo (Hp-Exo) enhanced M2 macrophage polarization both in vivo and in vitro. Microarray analysis revealed significant enrichment of microRNA (miR)-182-5p in Hp-Exo compared with that in N-Exo. In addition, miR-182-5p knockdown partially abolished the beneficial effect of Hp-Exo. Finally, Hp-MSC-derived exosomal miR-182-5p inhibited theprotein expression of forkhead box transcription factor 1 (FOXO1) in macrophages, which inhibited toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression and subsequently induced an anti-inflammatory response. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of Hp-Exo in liver regeneration and suggest that miR-182-5p from Hp-Exo facilitates macrophage polarization during liver regeneration by modulating the FOXO1/TLR4 signaling pathway.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is one of the most common refractory epilepsies and is usually accompanied by a range of brain pathological changes, such as neuronal injury and astrocytosis. Na\\u00efve astrocytes are readily converted to cytotoxic reactive astrocytes (A1) in response to inflammatory stimulation, suppressing the polarization of A1 protects against neuronal death in early central nervous system injury. Our previous study found that pro-inflammatory cytokines and miR-132-3p (hereinafter referred to as \\\"miR-132\\\") expression were upregulated, but how miR-132 affected reactive astrocyte polarization and neuronal damage during epilepsy is not fully understood. Here, we aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of miR-132 on A1 polarization. Our results confirmed that A1 markers were significantly elevated in the hippocampus of MTLE rats and IL-1\\u03b2-treated primary astrocytes. In vivo, knockdown of miR-132 by lateral ventricular injection reduced A1 astrocytes, neuronal loss, mossy fiber sprouting, and remitted the severity of status epilepticus and the recurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures. In vitro, the neuronal cell viability and axon length were reduced by additional treatment with A1 astrocyte conditioned media (ACM), and downregulation of astrocyte miR-132 rescued the inhibition of cell activity by A1 ACM, while the length of axons was further inhibited. The regulation of miR-132 on A1 astrocytes may be related to its target gene expression. Our results show that interfering with astrocyte polarization may be a breakthrough in the treatment of refractory epilepsy, which may extend to the research of other astrocyte polarization-mediated brain injuries.\",\n",

The synthesized material was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer, particle size, scanning electron microscope, Thermogravimetric Analysis Thermal, X-ray diffraction spectrophotometer and Zeta potential.\\nIn-vitro bioavailability of synthesized group ZnO (120 nm) was 43%, whereas for standard group ZnO (50 nm) was reported as 55%. In-vivo bioavailability of zinc oxide illustrated the maximum absorption level compared with the control. In-vivo toxicity was characterized as damage done to the liver and spleen tissues with a high dose of 0.21 mg/kg, while smaller doses indicated no toxic effects.\\nThe study provided important insights on the toxicological effects of ZnO nanoparticles, depending on dose rate and bio-assimilation, as well as particles, under various conditions (in-vitro and in-vivo). These findings will motivate further detailed research on nano-based medicine for alleviating malnutrition conditions.\",\n",

Further evaluation was conducted in clinical samples for in vitro and in vivo experiments, to prove the potential possibility that ZFP36 dysregulation participated in the malignant phenotype of PCa, to determine its potential mechanism for tumor regulation, and to provide a new theoretical basis for gene therapy of PCa.\\nFirst, the expression of ZFP36 in prostate tissue and PCa tissue was explored, and the relationship between ZFP36 and clinical features of PCa patients was illustrated. Subsequently, the impact of ZFP36 on the biology of PCa cells and relevant downstream pathways of ZFP36's biological impact on PCa were elucidated. Finally, whether oxidative stress mediated the regulation of ZFP36 in PCa was verified by the determination of oxidative stress-related indicators and bioinformatics analysis.\\nThe downregulation of ZFP36 in PCa tissue had a positive correlation with high Gleason scores, advanced pathological stage, and biochemical recurrence. ZFP36 was identified as an independent prognostic factor for PCa patients' BCR-free survival (\\nIn PCa, ZFP36 might be a tumor suppressor that regulated growth, invasion, and migration of PCa cells. The lately discovered ZFP36-CDK6 axis demonstrated the molecular mechanism of PCa progression to a certain extent which might act as a new possible therapeutic target of PCa therapy.\",\n",

And mice collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model was employed to verify these key genes.\\nA total of 1,885 up-regulated and 1,899 down-regulated DEGs were identified in RA samples. The ssGSEA analysis showed that the infiltration of 25 cells was significantly different. 603 immune related genes were obtained by WGCNA, and 270 DEIRGs were obtained by taking the intersection of DEGs and immune related genes. Enrichment analyses indicated that DEIRGs were associated with immunity related biological processes. 4 candidate biomarkers (\\nOur study identified \",\n",

Particularly, hypomethylation of the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP) has been reported in patients with AD.\\nIn this study, we used catalytically inactivated Cas9 (dCas9) fused with Dnmt3a for targeted DNA methylation of APP, and showed that the CRISPR/dCas9-Dnmt3a-mediated DNA methylation system could efficiently induce targeted DNA methylation of APP both in vivo and in vitro.\\nWe hypothesized that the targeted methylation of the APP promoter might rescue AD-related neuronal cell death by reducing APP mRNA expression. The cultured APP-KI mouse primary neurons exhibited an altered DNA-methylation pattern on the APP promoter after dCas9-Dnmt3a treatment. Likewise, the APP mRNA level was significantly reduced in the dCas9-Dnmt3a-treated wild-type and APP-KI mouse primary neurons. We also observed decreased amyloid-beta (A\\u03b2) peptide level and A\\u03b242/40 ratio in the dCas9-Dnmt3a-treated APP-KI mouse neurons compared to the control APP-KI mouse neurons. In addition, neuronal cell death was significantly decreased in the dCas9-Dnmt3a-treated APP-KI mouse neurons. Furthermore, the in vivo methylation of APP in the brain via dCas9-Dnmt3a treatment altered A\\u03b2 plaques and attenuated cognitive and behavioral impairments in the\\u00a0APP-KI mouse model.\\nThese results suggest that the targeted methylation of APP via dCas9-Dnmt3a treatment can be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.\",\n",

Our study aimed to disclose the role of circ-CSNK1G1 in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).\\nThe expression of circ-CSNK1G1, miR-28-5p and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and the expression of LDHA protein was measured by western blot. Cell proliferation was assessed using MTT assay and colony formation assay. Cell apoptosis was monitored using flow cytometry assay. Cell migration and cell invasion were investigated using transwell assay. Glycolysis progression was assessed according to glucose consumption, lactate production and ATP/ADP ratio. Tumor formation assay in nude mice was conducted to verify the role of circ-CSNK1G1 in vivo. The interplays between miR-28-5p and circ-CSNK1G1 or LDHA were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay.\\nCirc-CSNK1G1 was upregulated in TNBC tissues and cells. Circ-CSNK1G1 knockdown suppressed cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis energy metabolism, promoted cell apoptosis in vitro, and blocked tumor growth in vivo. Mechanism analysis showed that circ-CSNK1G1 positively regulated LDHA expression by suppressing miR-28-5p. Rescue experiments presented that circ-CSNK1G1 played functions by targeting miR-28-5p, and miR-28-5p participated in TNBC progression by degrading LDHA.\\nCirc-CSNK1G1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis metabolism during TNBC development by regulating the miR-28-5p/LDHA pathway.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Neurons born in the embryo can undergo a protracted period of maturation lasting well into postnatal life. How gene expression changes are regulated during maturation and whether they can be recapitulated in cultured neurons remains poorly understood. Here, we show that mouse motor neurons exhibit pervasive changes in gene expression and accessibility of associated regulatory regions from embryonic till juvenile age. While motifs of selector transcription factors, ISL1 and LHX3, are enriched in nascent regulatory regions, motifs of NFI factors, activity-dependent factors, and hormone receptors become more prominent in maturation-dependent enhancers. Notably, stem cell-derived motor neurons recapitulate ~40% of the maturation expression program in vitro, with neural activity playing only a modest role as a late-stage modulator. Thus, the genetic maturation program consists of a core hardwired subprogram that is correctly executed in vitro and an extrinsically-controlled subprogram that is dependent on the in vivo context of the maturing organism.\",\n",

In vivo antitumor efficacy was evaluated in MMTV\\nFirst, candidate HSP90-derived MHC class II epitopes with high binding affinities across multiple human HLA class II genotypes were identified using in silico algorithms. Among the top 10 peptides, p485 and p527 were selected as promising Th1 immunity-inducing epitopes with low potential for Th2 immunity induction. The selected MHC class II HSP90 peptides induced strong antigen-specific T cell responses, which was induced by cross-priming of CD8\\nIn conclusion, we have provided the first preclinical evidence of the action mechanism of HSP90 peptide vaccines with a distinct potential for improving breast cancer treatment.\",\n",

Hedgehog activity was necessary to prevent premature differentiation of second heart field (SHF) cardiac\\u00a0progenitors in mouse embryos, and the Hedgehog transcription factor GLI1 was sufficient to delay differentiation of cardiac progenitors in\\u00a0vitro. GLI1 directly activated a de novo progenitor-specific network in\\u00a0vitro, akin to that of SHF progenitors in\\u00a0vivo, which prevented the onset of the cardiac differentiation program. A Hedgehog signaling-dependent active-to-repressive GLI transition functioned as a differentiation timer, restricting the progenitor network to the SHF. GLI1 expression was associated with progenitor status across germ layers, and it delayed the differentiation of neural progenitors in\\u00a0vitro, suggesting a broad role for Hedgehog signaling as a heterochronic pathway.\",\n",

Using a combination of human cohorts, next-generation sequencing, systems biology, and animal models, we show that bronchiectasis bacteriomes defined by the presence of Neisseria spp. associate with poor clinical outcomes, including exacerbations. Neisseria subflava cultivated from bronchiectasis patients promotes the loss of epithelial integrity and inflammation in primary epithelial cells. In\\u00a0vivo animal models of Neisseria subflava infection and metabolipidome analysis highlight immunoinflammatory functional gene clusters and provide evidence for pulmonary inflammation. The murine metabolipidomic data were validated with human Neisseria-dominant bronchiectasis samples and compared with disease in which Pseudomonas-, an established bronchiectasis pathogen, is dominant. Metagenomic surveillance of Neisseria across various respiratory disorders reveals broader importance, and the assessment of the home environment in bronchiectasis implies potential environmental sources of exposure. Thus, we identify Neisseria species as pathobionts in bronchiectasis, allowing for improved risk stratification in this high-risk group.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), a representative of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is ubiquitously spread in the environment and showing deleterious impacts on male steroidogenesis, including testosterone synthesis disorder. However, the precise mechanisms involved in B[a]P-induced steroidogenesis perturbation remains obscure. In the present study, we integrated in vivo tests, transcriptome profiling, in vitro assays, and conjoint in silico toxicological approaches to delineate the detailed mechanisms. In mouse models, we observed that B[a]P administration remarkably inhibited testosterone synthesis accompanied by ultrastructural impairments of mitochondria and mitophagosome formation in mouse Leydig cells. Transcriptome profiling showed that B[a]P down-regulated the expression of Ndufa9, Ndufa6, Ndufa10, and Ndufa5 in mouse testes, which are identified as critical genes involved in the assembly and functionality of mitochondrial complex I. In the in vitro tests, the bioactive B[a]P metabolite BPDE induced perturbation of testosterone synthesis by NDUFA10-mediated mitochondrial impairment, which was further exacerbated by mitophagy in TM3 Leydig cells. The findings of in silico toxicological analyses were highly consistent with the experimental observations and further unveiled that B[a]P/BPDE-involved PPAR\\u03b1 activation could serve as a molecular initiating event to trigger the decline in Ndufa10 expression and testosterone synthesis. Overall, we have shown the first evidence that mitochondrial compromise in Leydig cells is the extremely crucial target in B[a]P-induced steroidogenesis perturbation.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Doxorubicin (DOX) is a powerful anti-tumor anthracycline drug. However, its clinical use is limited due to the side effect of cardiotoxicity. Tanshinone I (Tan I) is one of the major tanshinones isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza. Studies have shown that Tan I is effective in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. However, the potential effects of Tan I against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) have yet to be explored.\\nThis study aimed to explore whether Tan I can protect against DIC and to reveal whether Tan I can exert anti-oxidative effect by regulating nuclear erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway.\\nDIC models were established in vivo by intravenous injection of DOX. Echocardiography was used to monitor the cardiac function of mice. Transmission electron microscopy was used to assess mitochondrial damage. Oxidative stress was measured by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining and western blotting. The accumulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 was detected by immunofluorescence. H9C2 cellular DIC model was established in vitro to explore the pharmacological mechanism. Nrf2 small interfering (si)-RNA was applied to H9C2 cells to explore whether Tan I exerted protective effect against DIC through Nrf2 signaling pathway. The protective effects of Tan I on mitochondrial function and mitochondrial membrane permeability were measured by MitoSOX\\u2122 Red and JC-1 staining assays, respectively.\\nIn vivo experiments revealed that Tan I could improve cardiac function and protect against DOX-induced myocardial structural damages in mice models. The oxidative stress induced by DOX was suppressed and apoptosis was mitigated by Tan I treatment. Tan I protected against DOX-induced mitochondrial structural damage. Meanwhile, key proteins in Nrf2 pathways were upregulated by Tan I treatment. In vitro studies showed that Tan I attenuated DOX-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cultured H9C2 cells, reduced apoptotic rates, protected mitochondrial functions and up-regulated Nrf2 signaling pathway. Tan I promoted accumulation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 protein. In addition, interference of Nrf2 abrogated the anti-oxidative effects of Tan I and reversed the expressions of key proteins in Nrf2 pathway. The protective effects of Tan I on mitochondrial integrity was also mitigated by Nrf2 interference.\\nTan I could reduce oxidative stress and protect against DIC through regulating Nrf2 signaling pathway. Nrf2 is a potential target and Tan I is a novel candidate agent for the treatment of DIC.\",\n",

Fructus ligustri lucidi (FLL) has a long historical application in traditional Chinese medicine due to its various pharmacological effects, including antioxidation and anti-inflammation. The present study aimed to explore the molecular and cellular mechanisms of FLL in treating colitis.\\nA high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with ultraviolet (UV) was performed to validate the quality of FLL; Network pharmacology analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database predicted the therapeutic value of FLL against UC and CAC; 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was administered to mice to establish murine models of experimental colitis, and FLL was given for the next 14 days at different concentrations; 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were performed on fecal samples to delineate the alteration in microbiome profile; Western blotting, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry experiments were conducted to confirm the predicted cellular mechanisms.\\nNetwork pharmacology analysis and WGCNA predicted that the targets of the FLL were associated with the progression of UC and the survival of patients with colorectal cancer by regulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-17 signaling pathways, immune cell functions, responses to bacterial and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell proliferation. In vivo experiments corroborated that the high dose of FLL significantly attenuated the progression of experimental colitis by reversing the weight loss and bloody stool, reconstructing the integrity of colorectal epithelium, and suppressing the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, FLL treatment reduced the transition of macrophages (M\\u03c6s) to the proinflammatory phenotype and promoted M\\u03c6s-regulated wound healing, and suppressed the production of ROS in intestinal organoids (IOs) and crypts. 16S rRNA and untargeted metabolomics showed that the administration of FLL inhibited DSS-caused colonization of the potentially pathogenic gut microorganisms and reversed DSS-influenced metabolic profile.\\nFLL is a potent anti-colitis drug by suppressing inflammation and rescuing dysbiosis.\",\n",

Patchouli alcohol (PA), a major active ingredient isolated from Pogostemonis Herba, exhibits extensive bioactivity in the central nervous system (CNS) and exerts neuroprotective effects.\\nThis study aimed to investigate the anti-AD effects of PA in an animal model of AD and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms.\\nThe gas chromatography (GC) was used to determine the ability of PA to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in rats after oral administration. The sporadic AD rat model was established by intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injection with streptozotocin (STZ). PA (25 and 50\\u00a0mg/kg) was given to rat orally once daily for 42 consecutive days. Morris water maze (MWM) test was performed to determine the learning and memory functions of the STZ-induced AD rats. EX527, a silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) selective inhibitor, was used to investigate the involvement of SIRT1 in the anti-AD effects of PA in rats.\\nPA could penetrate the BBB. MWM test results showed that PA could significantly ameliorate the learning and memory deficits induced by STZ in rats. Meanwhile, PA enhanced the expression of SIRT1, and markedly alleviated the tau pathology by inhibiting the hyperacetylation (at the site of Lys174) and hyperphosphorylation (at the sites of Thr181, Thr205, Ser396 and Ser404) of tau protein. PA also efficiently suppressed the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and the beta-amyloid (A\\u03b2) expression and the deacetylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\\u03baB) at Lys 310 (K310) in the STZ-treated AD rats. EX527, a SIRT1 selective inhibitor, could partially abolish the cognitive deficits improving effect of PA and inhibit the down-regulation of acetylated tau and acetylated NF-\\u03baB p65, suggesting that PA exhibited neuroprotective effects against AD via upregulating SIRT1.\\nThis study reported for the first time that PA could penetrate the BBB to exert its protective effects on the brain after a single-dose oral administration. The current experimental findings also amply demonstrated that PA could improve the cognitive and memory impairments in the STZ-induced AD rat model. The underlying mechanisms involve the alleviations of neuroinflammation, tau pathology and A\\u03b2 deposition via modulating of SIRT1 and NF-\\u03baB pathways. All these findings strongly suggest that PA is a promising naturally occurring compound worthy of further development into an anti-AD pharmaceutical.\",\n",

Meanwhile, PA enhanced the expression of SIRT1, and markedly alleviated the tau pathology by inhibiting the hyperacetylation (at the site of Lys174) and hyperphosphorylation (at the sites of Thr181, Thr205, Ser396 and Ser404) of tau protein. PA also efficiently suppressed the activation of microglia and astrocytes, and the beta-amyloid (A\\u03b2) expression and the deacetylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\\u03baB) at Lys 310 (K310) in the STZ-treated AD rats. EX527, a SIRT1 selective inhibitor, could partially abolish the cognitive deficits improving effect of PA and inhibit the down-regulation of acetylated tau and acetylated NF-\\u03baB p65, suggesting that PA exhibited neuroprotective effects against AD via upregulating SIRT1.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Snakebite is a major public health concern in Eswatini, where treatment relies upon one antivenom-SAIMR Polyvalent. Although effective in treating snakebite, SAIMR Polyvalent is difficult to source outside its manufacturing country (South Africa) and is dauntingly expensive. We compared the preclinical venom-neutralising efficacy of two alternative antivenoms with that of SAIMR Polyvalent against the lethal and tissue-destructive effects of venoms from five species of medically important snakes using in vivo murine assays. The test antivenoms were 'Panafrican' manufactured by Instituto Clodomiro Picado and 'PANAF' manufactured by Premium Serums & Vaccines.\\nIn vivo murine preclinical studies identified both test antivenoms were equally or more effective than SAIMR Polyvalent at neutralising lethal and tissue-destructive effects of Naja mossambica venom. Both test antivenoms were less effective than SAIMR Polyvalent at neutralising the lethal effects of Bitis arietans, Dendroaspis polylepis, Hemachatus haemachatus and Naja annulifera venoms, but similarly effective at neutralising tissue damage induced by B. arietans and H. haemachatus venoms. In vitro immunological assays identified that the titres and toxin-specificities of immunoglobulins (iGs) in the test antivenoms were comparable to that of SAIMR Polyvalent. Plasma clotting disturbances by H. haemachatus and N. mossambica were neutralised by the test antivenoms, whereas SAIMR Polyvalent failed to neutralise this bioactivity of N. mossambica venom. B. arietans SVMP activity was equally reduced by all three antivenoms, and H. haemachatus and N. mossambica PLA2 activities were neutralised by all three antivenoms.\\nWhile both Panafrican and PANAF antivenoms exhibited promising preclinical efficacies, both were less poly-specifically effective than SAIMR Polyvalent in these murine assays. The efficacy of these antivenoms against the lethal and tissue-destructive effects of N. mossambica venom, the most common biting species in Eswatini, identify that Panafrican and PANAF antivenoms offer effective alternatives to SAIMR Polyvalent for the treatment of snakebite in Eswatini, and potentially for neighbouring countries.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In contrast to molecular changes associated with increased inflammatory responses, little is known about intracellular counter-regulatory mechanisms that control signaling cascades associated with functional responses of neutrophils. Active RHO GTPases are typically considered as effector proteins that elicit cellular responses. Strikingly, we show here that RHOH, although being constitutively GTP-bound, limits neutrophil degranulation and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Mechanistically, RHOH is induced under inflammatory conditions and binds to non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA (NMHC IIA) in activated neutrophils in order to inhibit the transport of mitochondria and granules along actin filaments, which is partially reverted upon disruption of the interaction with NMHC IIA by introducing a mutation in RhoH at lysine 34 (RhoHK34A). In parallel, RHOH inhibits actin polymerization presumably by modulating RAC1 activity. In vivo studies using Rhoh-/- mice, demonstrate an increased antibacterial defense capability against Escherichia coli (E. coli). Collectively, our data reveal a previously undefined role of RHOH as a molecular brake for actomyosin-mediated neutrophil effector functions, which represents an intracellular regulatory axis involved in controlling the strength of an antibacterial inflammatory response.\",\n",

Accessing the brain parenchyma is especially difficult for large polar molecules such as biotherapeutics and antibodies because of the blood-brain barrier. We investigated a new immunization strategy to identify novel receptors mediating transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier.\\nWe immunized mice with primary non-human primate brain microvascular endothelial cells to obtain antibodies. These antibodies were screened for their capacity to bind and to be internalized by primary non-human primate brain microvascular endothelial cells and Human Cerebral Microvascular Endothelial Cell clone D3. They were further evaluated for their transcytosis capabilities in three in vitro blood-brain barrier models. In parallel, their targets were identified by two different methods and their pattern of binding to human tissue was investigated using immunohistochemistry.\\n12 antibodies with unique sequence and internalization capacities were selected amongst more than six hundred. Aside from one antibody targeting Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule and one targeting Striatin3, most of the other antibodies recognized \\u03b21 integrin and its heterodimers. The antibody with the best transcytosis capabilities in all blood-brain barrier in vitro models and with the best binding capacity was an anti-\\u03b1n\\u03b21 integrin. In comparison, commercial anti-integrin antibodies performed poorly in transcytosis assays, emphasizing the originality of the antibodies derived here. Immunohistochemistry studies showed specific vascular staining on human and non-human primate tissues.\\nThis transcytotic behavior has not previously been reported for anti-integrin antibodies. Further studies should be undertaken to validate this new mechanism in vivo and to evaluate its potential in brain delivery.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"T cells recognize their ligand, the peptide major histocompatibility complex (MHC), via the T-cell receptor (TCR), which is composed of covalently linked \\u03b1 and \\u03b2 or \\u03b3 and \\u03b4 chains. This recognition is critical for T-cell ontogeny and controls the selection, activation, and function of T lymphocytes. Specific TCR \\u03b1\\u03b2 variable regions have been associated with immunopathogenesis of Chagas disease. Here, we present a systematic review that compiles experimental in vivo and human data regarding the preferential expression of variable alpha (V\\u03b1) and variable beta (V\\u03b2) chain regions in Trypanosoma cruzi infection. The original studies indexed in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were screened according to the PRISMA strategy. The analysis showed that expression of TCR V\\u03b1 subfamilies were evaluated in one human study, and, unlike TCR V\\u03b2, TCR V\\u03b1 presented a more restricted usage. Despite the great variability in the usage of TCR V\\u03b2 regions in human Chagas disease, a down-regulation of TCR V\\u03b25 expression by T cells from patients in the acute phase of the disease was shown. Opposingly, this TCR region was found overly expressed in CD4+ T cells from chronic Chagas patients. It was also demonstrated that murine V\\u03b29+ T cells derived from nonlymphoid organs of T. cruzi-infected animals had a modulatory profile, while splenic V\\u03b29+ T cells produced inflammatory cytokines, indicating that although they display the same TCR V\\u03b2 region usage, these cells are functionally distinct. Despite the limitations of few papers and year of publication of the studies, compiling the data derived from them reveals that further investigation of TCR usage will point to their potential role in protective or pathogenic responses, as biomarkers of disease progression, and in the search for dominant peptides potentially useful for the development of vaccines or therapies.\",\n",

Here, we investigated whether alterations of ELK1 lead to progression of bladder cancer (BCa), a main neoplasm of urinary tract, and clarified the function of ELK1 in BCa. Using the GEO database, we identified ELK1 as the most significantly overexpressed gene in BCa, which was substantiated in the acquired clinical samples and cells. Silencing of ELK1 inhibited the malignant phenotype of BCa cells. Further analysis revealed that ELK1 synergized with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) to specifically bind to the synaptotagmin like 1 (SYTL1) promoter, thereby repressing SYTL1 transcription and protein expression. Depletion of SYTL1 reversed the repressive effects of ELK1 depletion on the malignant phenotype of BCa cells. Our in vitro findings were reproduced in vivo on a nude mouse tumorigenic model. Together, our results reveal that ELK1, through suppression of SYTL1 via HDAC2, supports the malignant phenotype of BCa cells.\",\n",

However, studies of hemodynamic function in health and disease have lacked a method to control arteriole diameter independently with high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we describe an all-optical approach to manipulate and monitor brain arteriole contractility in mice in three dimensions using combined in vivo two-photon optogenetics and imaging. The expression of the red-shifted excitatory opsin, ReaChR, in vascular smooth muscle cells enabled rapid and repeated vasoconstriction controlled by brief light pulses. Two-photon activation of ReaChR using a spatial light modulator produced highly localized constrictions when targeted to individual arterioles within the neocortex. We demonstrate the utility of this method for examining arteriole contractile dynamics and creating transient focal blood flow reductions. Additionally, we show that optogenetic constriction can be used to reshape vasodilatory responses to sensory stimulation, providing a valuable tool to dissociate blood flow changes from neural activity.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"R-spondins (RSPOs) are influential signaling molecules that promote the Wnt/\\u03b2-catenin pathway and self-renewal of stem cells. Currently, RSPOs are emerging as clinically relevant oncogenes, being linked to cancer development in multiple organs. Although this has instigated the rapid development and testing of therapeutic antibodies targeting RSPOs, functional evidence that RSPO causally drives cancer has focused primarily on the intestinal tract. Here, we assess the oncogenic capacity of RSPO in breast cancer in a direct fashion by generating and characterizing a novel mouse model with conditional Rspo3 expression in the mammary gland. We also address the prevalence of RSPO gene alterations in breast cancer patients. We found that a quarter of breast cancer patients harbor RSPO2/RSPO3 copy number amplifications, which are associated with lack of steroid hormone receptor expression and reduced patient survival. Foremost, we demonstrate the causal oncogenic capacity of RSPO3 in the breast, as conditional Rspo3 overexpression consistently drives the development of mammary adenocarcinomas in our novel Rspo3 breast cancer model. RSPO3-driven mammary tumors typically show poor differentiation, areas of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and metastatic potential. Given the reported interplay in the Wnt/\\u03b2-catenin pathway, we comparatively analyzed RSPO3-driven mouse mammary tumors versus classical WNT1-driven analogues. This revealed that RSPO3-driven tumors are distinct, as the poorly differentiated tumor morphology and metastatic potential were observed in RSPO3-driven tumorigenesis exclusively, further substantiated by differentiating gene expression profiles. Co-expression of Rspo3 and Wnt1 transduced mammary tumors with a mixed phenotype harboring morphological features characteristic of both transgenes. In summary, we report that a quarter of breast cancer patients harbor RSPO2/RSPO3 copy number gains, and these patients have a worse prognosis, whilst providing in vivo evidence that RSPO3 drives poorly differentiated invasive breast cancer in mice. Herewith, we establish RSPO3 as a driver of breast cancer with clinical relevance, proposing RSPO3 as a novel candidate target for therapy in breast cancer. \\u00a9 2022 The Authors.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Genital mycoplasmas can break the cervical barrier and cause intraamniotic infection and preterm birth. This study developed a six-chamber vagina-cervix-decidua-organ-on-a-chip (VCD-OOC) that recapitulates the female reproductive tract during pregnancy with culture chambers populated by vaginal epithelial cells, cervical epithelial and stromal cells, and decidual cells. Cells cultured in VCD-OOC were characterized by morphology and immunostaining for cell-specific markers. We transferred the media from the decidual cell chamber of the VCD-OOC to decidual cell chamber in feto-maternal interface organ-on-a-chip (FMi-OOC), which contains the fetal membrane layers. An ascending Ureaplasma parvum infection was created in VCD-OOC. U. parvum was monitored for 48\\u2009h post-infection with their cytotoxicity (LDH assay) and inflammatory effects (multiplex cytokine assay) in the cells tested. An ascending U. parvum infection model of PTB was developed using CD-1 mice. The cell morphology and expression of cell-specific markers in the VCD-OOC mimicked those seen in lower genital tract tissues. U. parvum reached the cervical epithelial cells and decidua within 48\\u2009h and did not cause cell death in VCD-OOC or FMi-OOC cells. U. parvum infection promoted minimal inflammation, while the combination of U. parvum and LPS promoted massive inflammation in the VCD-OOC and FMi-OOC cells. In the animal model, U. parvum vaginal inoculation of low-dose U. parvum did not result in PTB, and even a high dose had only some effects on PTB (20%). However, intra-amniotic injection of U. parvum resulted in 67% PTB. We report the colonization of U. parvum in various cell types; however, inconsistent, and low-grade inflammation across multiple cell types suggests poor immunogenicity induced by U. parvum.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The poor skin permeation and deposition of topical therapeutic drugs is a major issue in topical drug delivery, improving this issue is conducive to improving the topical therapeutic effect of drugs.\\nIn this study, octadecylamine modified hyaluronic acid (OHA) copolymer was synthesized by amide reaction technique to prepare curcumin (CUR)-loaded micelles (CUR-M) for topical transdermal administration. CUR-M was successfully prepared by dialysis, and the formulation was evaluated for particle size, zeta potential, surface morphology, entrapment effciency (EE%), drug loading (DL), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and the in vitro drug release. Additionally, in vitro skin permeation and retention, in vivo topical analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity, and skin irritation were assessed.\\nThe mean drug loading (DL), drug entrapment efficiency (EE), hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of CUR-M were 8.26%, 90.86%, 165.64 nm and -26.85 mV, respectively. CUR-M was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), it was found that there was an interaction between CUR and OHA, and CUR existed in CUR-M in an amorphous form. CUR-M exhibited sustained release in 48 h and good stability at 4 \\u00b0C for 21days. CUR-M could significantly increase the skin penetration and retention of CUR and had better analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities in vivo when compared with CUR solution. Hematoxylin-eosin staining results revealed that the transdermal penetration mechanism of CUR-M might be related to the hydration of stratum corneum by HA. In addition, CUR-M showed no skin irritation to mouse skin.\\nCUR-M might be a promising and safe drug delivery system for the treatment of topical diseases.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent malignancy in women. This study is aimed to explore the role and regulatory mechanism of RNA-binding motif protein 8A (RBM8A) in BC.\\nWe detected the expression of RBM8A in BC tissues and cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-436), and explored the correlation of RBM8A expression with clinicopathological features in patients. The function of RBM8A deficiency in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was determined using MTT, wound healing, and transwell assay. The effect of RBM8A suppression on the cisplatin (DDP) resistance in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was also evaluated. Besides, western blotting was used to examine AKT/mTOR pathway-related proteins. The mouse model was constructed to confirm the effect of RBM8A on tumor growth.\\nThe expression of RBM8A was elevated in BC tissues and cell lines. RBM8A silencing restrained the malignant behaviors of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, including viability, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis. Silencing of RBM8A overcame resistance to DDP in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, RBM8A suppression restrained the activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Feedback experiments revealed that SC79 treatment reversed the reduction effects of RBM8A knockdown on viability, DDP resistance, migration, and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, the silencing of RBM8A inhibited the growth of tumor xenograft \\nRBM8A knockdown may reduce DDP resistance in BC to repress the development of BC via the AKT/mTOR pathway, suggesting that RBM8A may serve as a new therapeutic target in BC.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) has been reported to play key roles in a variety of cancers by degrading the extracellular matrix. However, its carcinogenic roles have not been shown yet in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This study aimed to elucidate its expression pattern and functional roles as well as clinical significance in HNSCC. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were utilized to determine the MMP1 expression pattern and the associations between its expression and patients' outcome in HNSCC. Mice tongue squamous cell carcinoma model induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) and siRNA-mediated cellular assay in vitro were utilized to evaluate the oncogenic role of MMP1. The biological functions and cancer-related pathways involved in MMP1-related genes were found through bioinformatics analysis. Both mRNA and protein abundance of MMP1 were highly increased in HNSCC as compared to its non-tumor counterparts. MMP1 overexpression positively correlated with advanced tumor size, cervical node metastasis, and advanced pathological grade and lower patients' survival. In the 4NQO-induced animal model, MMP1 expression increased along with the progression of the disease. In HNSCC cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown of MMP1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and activated apoptosis and epithelia-mesenchymal transition (EMT). GSEA, GO, and KEGG analyses showed that MMP1 expression was significantly related to cancer-related pathways and cancer-related functions. Together, our results demonstrated MMP1 serves as a novel prognostic biomarker and putative oncogene in HNSCC.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness and a common ocular complication of diabetes. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lens epithelial cells (LECs) and altered autophagic activity occur during the development of diabetic cataracts. The disturbed interaction of autophagy with EMT in LECs stimulated by high glucose levels may participate in cataract formation.\\nA rat diabetic cataract model induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and human lens epithelial cells (HLE-B3) stimulated with a high glucose concentration were employed in the study. These models were treated with rapamycin (an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)), and N-(N-[3,5-difluorophenacetyl]-1-alanyl)-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT, an inhibitor of \\u03b3-secretase) alone or in combination. Lens opacity was observed and photographed under a slit-lamp microscope. Histological changes in paraffin sections of lenses were detected under a light microscope after hematoxylin and eosin staining. Alterations of autophagosomes in LECs were counted and evaluated under a transmission electron microscope. The expression levels of proteins involved in the EMT, autophagy, and the signaling pathways in LECs were measured using Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. Cell migration was determined by performing transwell and scratch wound assays. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was performed to verify protein-protein interactions. Proteins were overexpressed in transfected cells to confirm their roles in the signaling pathways of interest.\\nIn LECs, a high glucose concentration induces the EMT by activating Jagged1/Notch1/Notch intracellular domain (NICD)/Snail signaling and inhibits autophagy through the AKT/mTOR/unc 51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro, resulting in diabetic cataracts. Enhanced autophagic activity induced by rapamycin suppressed the EMT by inducing Notch1 degradation by SQSTM1/p62 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) in LECs, while inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway with DAPT not only prevented the EMT but also activated autophagy by decreasing the levels of NICD, which bound to ULK1, phosphorylated it, and then inhibited the initiation of autophagy.\\nWe describe a new interaction of autophagy and the EMT involving NICD/ULK1 signaling, which mediates crosstalk between these two important events in the formation of diabetic cataracts. Activating autophagy and suppressing the EMT mutually promote each other, revealing a potential target and strategy for the prevention of diabetic cataracts.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"In our search for innovative drugs that could improve periodontal treatment outcomes, autophagy and its anomalies represent a potential target for therapeutic intervention. We sought to identify autophagy defects in murine experimental periodontitis and study the effectiveness of P140, a phosphopeptide known to bind HSPA8 and inhibit its chaperone properties, and that corrects autophagy dysfunctions in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Experimental periodontitis was induced by placing silk ligature around mandibular first molars. Sick mice were treated intraperitoneally with either P140 or a control, scrambled peptide. After 10\\u00a0days, mandibles were harvested and bone loss was measured by micro-CT. Immune cells infiltration was studied by histological analyses. Cytokines levels and autophagy-related markers expression were evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blotting. A comparison with non-affected mice revealed significant alterations in the autophagy processes in mandibles of diseased mice, especially in the expression of sequestosome\\u00a01/p62, Maplc3b, Atg5, Ulk1, and Lamp2. In vivo, we showed that P140 normalized the dysregulated expression of several autophagy-related genes. In addition, it diminished the infiltration of activated lymphocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Unexpectedly P140 decreased the extent of bone loss affecting the furcation and alveolar areas. Our results indicate that P140, which was safe in clinical trials including hundreds of autoimmune patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, not only decreases the inflammatory effects observed in mandibular tissues of ligation-induced mice but strikingly also contributes to bone preservation. Therefore, the therapeutic peptide P140 could be repositioned as a decisive breakthrough for the future therapeutic management of periodontitis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"The Ets transcription factor PU.1 is essential for inducing the differentiation of monocytes, macrophages, and B cells in fetal liver and adult bone marrow. PU.1 controls hematopoietic differentiation through physical interactions with other transcription factors, such as C/EBP\\u03b1 and the AP-1 family member c-Jun. We found that PU.1 recruits c-Jun to promoters without the AP-1 binding sites. To address the functional importance of this interaction, we generated PU.1 point mutants that do not bind c-Jun while maintaining normal DNA binding affinity. These mutants lost the ability to transactivate a target reporter that requires a physical PU.1-c-Jun interaction, and did not induce monocyte/macrophage differentiation of PU.1-deficient cells. Knock-in mice carrying these point mutations displayed an almost complete block in hematopoiesis and perinatal lethality. While the PU.1 mutants were expressed in hematopoietic stem and early progenitor cells, myeloid differentiation was severely blocked, leading to an almost complete loss of mature hematopoietic cells. Differentiation into mature macrophages could be restored by expressing PU.1 mutant fused to c-Jun, demonstrating that a physical PU.1-c-Jun interaction is crucial for the transactivation of PU.1 target genes required for myeloid commitment and normal PU.1 function in vivo during macrophage differentiation.\",\n",

Here we propose a mechanism for initial pathology based on results obtained using a recently developed Osteoadsorptive Fluogenic Sentinel (OFS) probe that emits a fluorescent signal triggered by cathepsin K (Ctsk) activity. In a ligature-induced mouse model of periodontitis, a strong OFS signal is observed before the establishment of chronic inflammation and bone resorption. Single cell RNA sequencing shows gingival fibroblasts to be the primary cellular source of early Ctsk. The in vivo OFS signal is activated when Toll-Like Receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand or oral biofilm extracellular DNA (eDNA) is topically applied to the mouse palatal gingiva. This previously unrecognized interaction between oral microbial eDNA and Ctsk of gingival fibroblasts provides a pathological mechanism for disease initiation and a strategic basis for early diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Implantation of guide cannulas is a widely used technique to access specific brain areas. Although commercially available, the need to personalize these implants and the high cost prompted us to design open-source customized devices taking advantage of 3D printing technology. Our cannulas consisted in a 3D-printed head mount designed according to the Paxinos coordinates to reach the CA1 area of the hippocampus. To cut guide cannulas to the proper length, we designed and realized an original 3D-printed linear motion apparatus. Polylactic acid thermoplastic polymer was used as printing material. Homemade or commercial cannulas were implanted in 4- to 6-month-old wild-type mice and intrahippocampal injections of amyloid-\\u03b2 peptide at different concentrations were performed. \",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Activation of the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway has been extensively described as a pivotal mechanism to escape immune surveillance and elicits suppressive effect on antitumor immunity. Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction by checkpoint inhibitors has been shown to result in tumor shrinkage and prolong patient survival. However, regulatory machinery for PD-1/PD-L1 expression is largely unknown.\\nWe used bioinformatic tools and biochemical methods to investigate the significance of F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7 (FBW7) in regulating PD-1 protein stability. By generating a panel of FBW7 and PD-1 encoding plasmids, we expressed FBW7 and PD-1 or their mutants to performed immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays. The efficacy of cotargeting FBW7 to enhance antitumor immunity was evaluated in C57BL/6J mice. These laboratory findings were further validated in tumor samples obtained from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\\nWe identified FBW7 as a E3 ubiquitin ligase for PD-1 protein, in which FBW7 promotes the K48-linked polyubiquitination of PD-1 protein at Lys233 residue. Cotargeting FBW7 accelerates PD-1 protein degradation and enhances antitumor immunity in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrated that cyclin-dependent kinase 1-mediated phosphorylation of Ser261 residue primes PD-1 protein nucleus translocation and binding with FBW7. Higher expression of FBW7 characterizes a 'hot' tumor microenvironment and confers more favorable responses to PD-1 blockade therapy.\\nThis study highlights the critical role of FBW7 in determining PD-1 protein stability. FBW7 ubiquitinates PD-1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, as a consequence, leading to PD-1 protein degradation and cytotoxic lymphocytes infiltrating the tumor microenvironment. Screening FBW7 status would predict clinical response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC, and targeting FBW7 is a promising strategy to enhance antitumor immunity.\",\n",

Recent studies have revealed the critical role of \\nThe efficiency of Pos3Aa-p53 crystals in delivering p53 protein was evaluated using confocal imaging, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry and RNA-seq. The ability of Pos3Aa-p53 crystals to remodel tumor microenvironment was investigated by examining the markers of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and the expression of PD-L1, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase 2 and type I interferon (IFN). Finally, both unilateral and bilateral 4T1 tumor mouse models were utilized to assess the efficacy of Pos3Aa-p53 crystal-mediated p53 restoration in enhancing the antitumor activity of ICIs. T cells in tumor tissues and spleens were analyzed, and the in vivo biosafety of the Pos3Aa-p53 crystal/anti-PD-1 antibody combination was also evaluated.\\nDelivery of p53 protein into p53-null TNBC 4T1 cells via Pos3Aa-p53 crystals restored the p53 activity, and therefore led to the induction of ICD, activation of type I IFN signaling and upregulation of PD-L1 expression. Pos3Aa-p53 crystals significantly enhanced T cell infiltration and activation in 4T1 tumors, thereby sensitizing them to anti-PD-1 therapy. The combination of Pos3Aa-p53 crystals with anti-PD-1 antibody also induced a systemic antitumor immunity resulting in the inhibition of distal tumor growth with minimal toxicity.\\nThis study validates that p53 restoration can be an effective approach to overcome ICI resistance and demonstrates that intracellular delivery of p53 protein can be an efficient, safe and potentially universal strategy to restore p53 activity in tumors carrying \",\n",

Most studies have focused on investigating the role of CRC cell-specific CD155 on CRC progression, while the contribution of TAMs-specific CD155 is still unknown. Here, we sought to investigate the expression pattern of CD155 in CRC TAMs and its role in tumor immunity and progression.\\nCD155 expression patterns in CRC TAMs and macrophages in paratumor or adjacent normal tissue were analyzed in 50 patients with CRC using flow cytometry and in 141 patients with CRC using immunohistochemistry. The correlation of CD155 expression level in TAMs with M1 and M2 phenotypic transition was analyzed. The role of macrophage-specific CD155 in CRC progression and tumor immune response was investigated in vitro and in vivo. We further analyzed the effect of CRC cells on the regulation of CD155 expression in macrophages.\\nCRC TAMs from clinical samples showed robustly higher expression of CD155 than macrophages from paratumor and adjacent normal tissues.

      "    \"abstract\": \"Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that are involved in controlling tumors or microbial infections through the production of interferon gamma (IFN-\\u03b3). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) inhibits IFN-\\u03b3 secretion by NK cells, but the mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. Here, by comparing the multi-omics profiles of human NK cells before and after in\\u00a0vivo G-CSF treatment, we identify a pathway that is activated in response to G-CSF treatment, which suppresses IFN-\\u03b3 secretion in NK cells. Specifically, glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) activated by G-CSF inhibit secretion of IFN-\\u03b3 by promoting interactions between SOCS1 promoters and enhancers, as well as increasing the expression of SOCS1. Experiments in mice confirm that G-CSF treatment significantly downregulates IFN-\\u03b3 secretion and upregulates GR and SOCS1 expression in NK cells. In addition, GR blockade by the antagonist RU486 significantly reverses the effects of G-CSF, demonstrating that GRs upregulate SOCS1 and inhibit the production of IFN-\\u03b3 by NK cells.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Brain computer interfaces (BCIs), including penetrating microelectrode arrays, enable both recording and stimulation of neural cells. However, device implantation inevitably causes injury to brain tissue and induces a foreign body response, leading to reduced recording performance and stimulation efficacy. Astrocytes in the healthy brain play multiple roles including regulating energy metabolism, homeostatic balance, transmission of neural signals, and neurovascular coupling. Following an insult to the brain, they are activated and gather around the site of injury. These reactive astrocytes have been regarded as one of the main contributors to the formation of a glial scar which affects the performance of microelectrode arrays. This study investigates the dynamics of astrocytes within the first 2 weeks after implantation of an intracortical microelectrode into the mouse brain using two-photon microscopy. From our observation astrocytes are highly dynamic during this period, exhibiting patterns of process extension, soma migration, morphological activation, and device encapsulation that are spatiotemporally distinct from other glial cells, such as microglia or oligodendrocyte precursor cells. This detailed characterization of astrocyte reactivity will help to better understand the tissue response to intracortical devices and lead to the development of more effective intervention strategies to improve the functional performance of neural interfacing technology.\",\n",

Our goal was to evaluate the contribution of Syk and its two splice variants, full length Syk (L) and short isoform Syk (S), in the tumor biology of colorectal cancer cells (CRC). The analysis of Syk expression in primary human colorectal tumors, as well as the analysis of TCGA database, revealed a high Syk mRNA expression score in colorectal cancer tumors, suggesting a tumor promotor role of Syk in CRC. Our analysis showed that Syk (L) isoform is highly expressed in the majority of the tumor tissues and that it remains expressed in tumors in which global Syk expression is downregulated, suggesting the dependence of tumors to Syk (L) isoform. We also identified a small cluster of tumor tissues, which express a high proportion of Syk (S) isoform. This specific cluster is associated with overexpressed genes related to translation and mitochondria, and down regulated genes implicated in the progression of mitosis. For our functional studies, we used short hairpin RNA tools to target the expression of Syk in CRC cells bearing the activating K-Ras (G13D) mutation. Our results showed that while global Syk knock down increases cell proliferation and cell motility, Syk (L) expression silencing affects the viability and induces the apoptosis of the cells, confirming the dependence of cells on Syk (L) isoform for their survival. Finally, we report the promising potential of compound C-13, an original non-enzymatic inhibitor of Syk isolated in our group. In vitro studies showed that C-13 exerts cytotoxic effects on Syk-positive CRC cells by inhibiting their proliferation and their motility, and by inducing their apoptosis, while Syk-negative cell lines viability was not affected. Moreover, the oral and intraperitoneal administration of C-13 reduced the tumor growth of CRC DLD-1 cells xenografts in Nude mice in vivo.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 in most cases, but some patients develop an excessive inflammatory process that can be fatal. As the NLRP3 inflammasome and additional inflammasomes are implicated in disease aggravation, drug repositioning to target inflammasomes emerges as a strategy to treat COVID-19. Here, we performed a high-throughput screening using a 2560 small-molecule compound library and identified FDA-approved drugs that function as pan-inflammasome inhibitors. Our best hit, niclosamide (NIC), effectively inhibits both inflammasome activation and SARS-CoV-2 replication. Mechanistically, induction of autophagy by NIC partially accounts for inhibition of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, but NIC-mediated inhibition of NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome are autophagy independent. NIC potently inhibited inflammasome activation in human monocytes infected in vitro, in PBMCs from patients with COVID-19, and in vivo in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study provides relevant information regarding the immunomodulatory functions of this promising drug for COVID-19 treatment.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a significant complication of diabetes and the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Hyperglycemia-induced dysfunction of the glomerular podocytes is a major contributor to the deterioration of renal function in DN. Previously, we demonstrated that podocyte-specific disruption of the Src homology phosphatase 2 (Shp2) ameliorated lipopolysaccharide-induced renal injury. This study aims to evaluate the contribution of Shp2 to podocyte function under hyperglycemia and explore the molecular underpinnings. We report elevated Shp2 in the E11 podocyte cell line under high glucose and the kidney under streptozotocin- and high-fat diet-induced hyperglycemia. Consistently, Shp2 disruption in podocytes was associated with partial renoprotective effects under hyperglycemia, as evidenced by the preserved renal function. At the molecular level, Shp2 deficiency was associated with altered renal insulin signaling and diminished hyperglycemia-induced renal endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Additionally, Shp2 knockdown in E11 podocytes mimicked the in vivo deficiency of this phosphatase and ameliorated the deleterious impact of high glucose, whereas Shp2 reconstitution reversed these effects. Moreover, Shp2 deficiency attenuated high glucose-induced E11 podocyte migration. Further, we identified the protein tyrosine kinase FYN as a putative mediator of Shp2 signaling in podocytes under high glucose. Collectively, these findings suggest that Shp2 inactivation may afford protection to podocytes under hyperglycemia and highlight this phosphatase as a potential target to ameliorate glomerular dysfunction in DN.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Asthma is an airway disease characterized by airflow limitation and various additional clinical manifestations. Repeated inflammatory stimulation of the airways leads to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which aggravates subepithelial fibrosis during the process of airway remodelling and enhances resistance to corticosteroids and bronchodilators in refractory asthma. There is growing evidence that IL-27 modulates airway remodelling, however, the molecular mechanisms involving IL-27 and EMT are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of IL-27 on ovalbumin (OVA)-challenged asthmatic mice in vivo and TGF-\\u03b21-induced EMT in 16HBE cells in vitro.\\nAirway inflammation, mucus secretion, and collagen deposition were analysed by conventional pathological techniques. The ratio of Th17 and Th9 cells in the spleen of mice was measured using flow cytometry, ELISA was performed for cytokine analysis to identify EMT-related molecules and signalling pathways, and other molecular and cellular techniques were used to explore the functional mechanism involving IL-27 and EMT.\\nAirway inflammation in asthmatic mice was significantly alleviated by IL-27, with downregulation of RhoA and ROCK, upregulation of E-cadherin, and a decrease of vimentin and \\u03b1-SMA expression, compared to asthmatic mice. Moreover, the frequency of Th17 and Th9 cells in the spleen of asthmatic mice decreased following treatment with IL-27. In TGF-\\u03b21-induced 16HBE cells, the addition of IL-27 was shown to inhibit EMT, based on the expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, and \\u03b1-SMA.\\nIntranasal administration of IL-27 attenuates airway inflammation and EMT in a murine model of allergic asthma possibly by downregulating the RhoA/ROCK signalling pathway.\",\n",

Herein, we explored the effect of hPRDX5 and the responsible mechanism in treating pancreatic cancer. Tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into normal PBS group and treatment group (n=5; 10 mg/kg hPRDX5). Flow cytometry was employed to examine lymphocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cell subsets, and the function proteins of natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood, spleen, and tumor tissues of mice. Western blot was used to measure the protein expressions of the key nodes in TLR4-MAPK-NF-\\u03baB signaling pathway. The rate of tumor suppression was 57.6% at a 10 mg/kg dose in orthotopic transplanted tumor mice. Moreover, the population of CD3+CD4+T cells, NK cells, and CD3+CD8+T cells was significantly increased in the tumor tissue of the hPRDX5 group, while the proportion of granulocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells decreased slightly. In addition, after treatment with hPRDX5, the percentage of NK cells in blood increased more than 4-fold. Our findings indicated that hPRDX5 effectively suppressed pancreatic cancer possibly via the TLR4-MAPK-NF-\\u03baB signaling cascade; hence hPRDX5 could be a prospective immunotherapy candidate for treating pancreatic cancer.\",\n",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of hederagenin on decreasing blood lipid and anti-oxidative stress in oleic acid-induced HepG2 cells and hyperlipidemic rats, and explore underlying mechanisms. In vitro, TG was used as the index to verify the lipid-lowering effect of hederagenin in oleic acid-induced HepG2 cells. In vivo, TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C were used as direct indicators to study the antilipemic effect of hederagenin in hyperlipidemic rats. MDA, SOD, and GSH-PX were measured to analyze the anti-oxidative effect of hederagenin. The signaling pathways of anti-oxidation were evaluated using Western blot. Our results showed that hederagenin (250\\u03bcmol/L) increased significantly TG clearance rate. In addition, treatment with hederagenin, XZK and simvastatin reduced effectively TC, TG, LDL-C and MDA content, and increased HDL-C, SOD and GSH-PX in HFD rats. Moreover, the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK was inhibited after administration of hederagenin, XZK and simvastatin. Our results revealed that hederagenin possessed beneficial potentials for hypolipidemic effects, especially in TG clearance. The mechanism might be associated with inhibition of lipid absorption, reduction of lipid oxidation, and down-regulation of p38MAPK phosphorylation.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Background Clinically, myocardial fibrosis is one of the most common complications caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the potential mechanisms of CKD-induced myocardial fibrosis have not been clarified. Methods and Results In our in vivo study, a rat model of CKD with 5/6 nephrectomy was established. The CKD model was treated with the glioma 1 (Gli-1) inhibitor GANT-61, and myocardial fibrosis and serum intact fibroblast growth factor 23 levels were assessed 16\\u2009weeks after nephrectomy. Finally, we found that Gli-1 and Smoothened in the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway were activated and that collagen-1 and collagen-3, which constitute the fibrotic index, were expressed in CKD myocardial tissue. After administering the Gli-1 inhibitor GANT-61, the degree of myocardial fibrosis was reduced, and Gli-1 expression was also inhibited. We also measured blood pressure, cardiac biomarkers, and other indicators in rats and performed hematoxylin-eosin staining of myocardial tissue. Furthermore, in vitro studies showed that intact fibroblast growth factor 23 promoted cardiac fibroblast proliferation and transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts by activating the Shh signaling pathway, thereby promoting cardiac fibrosis, as manifested by increased expression of the Shh, Patch 1, and Gli-1 mRNAs and Shh, Smoothened, and Gli-1 proteins in the Shh signaling pathway. The protein and mRNA levels of other fibrosis indicators, such as \\u03b1-smooth muscle actin, which are also markers of transdifferentiation, collagen-1, and collagen-3, were increased. Conclusions On the basis of these results, intact fibroblast growth factor 23 promotes CKD-induced myocardial fibrosis by activating the Shh signaling pathway.\",\n",

Ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated and studied using fluorescent Ca indicators and patch clamp. Expression levels and localization of SR Ca-handling proteins were evaluated using Western blotting and immunostaining.

Upon catecholamine stress, K180R ventricular cardiomyocytes exhibit increased spontaneous SR Ca release events, triggering delayed afterdepolarizations and spontaneous beats. K180R had no effect on levels of Casq2, Casq2 polymers, or other SR Ca-handling proteins. Intra-SR Ca measurements revealed that K180R impaired dynamic intra-SR Ca buffering, resulting in a more rapid rise of free Ca in the SR during diastole. Steady-state SR Ca buffering and total SR Ca content were not changed. Consistent with the reduced dynamic intra-SR buffering, K180R causes reduced SR Ca release refractoriness.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is one of the mechanisms of airway remodeling in chronic asthma. Interleukin (IL)-24 has been implicated in the promotion of tissue fibrosis, and increased IL-24 levels have been observed in the nasal secretions and sputum of asthmatic patients. However, the role of IL-24 in asthmatic airway remodeling, especially in EMT, remains largely unknown. We aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of IL-24 on EMT and to verify whether IL-37 could alleviate IL-24-induced EMT in chronic asthma.\\nBEAS-2B cells were exposed to IL-24, and cell migration was assessed by wound healing and Transwell assays. The expression of EMT-related biomarkers (E-cadherin, vimentin, and \\u03b1-SMA) was evaluated after the cells were stimulated with IL-24 with or without IL-37. A murine asthma model was established by intranasal administration of house dust mite (HDM) extracts for 5\\u00a0weeks, and the effects of IL-24 and IL-37 on EMT and airway remodeling were investigated by intranasal administration of si-IL-24 and rhIL-37.\\nWe observed that IL-24 significantly enhanced the migration of BEAS-2B cells in vitro. IL-24 promoted the expression of the EMT biomarkers vimentin and \\u03b1-SMA via the STAT3 and ERK1/2 pathways. In addition, we found that IL-37 partially reversed IL-24-induced EMT in BEAS-2B cells by blocking the ERK1/2 and STAT3 pathways. Similarly, the in vivo results showed that IL-24 was overexpressed in the airway epithelium of an HDM-induced chronic asthma model, and IL-24 silencing or IL-37 treatment could reverse EMT biomarker expression.\\nOverall, these findings indicated that IL-37 mitigated HDM-induced airway remodeling by inhibiting IL-24-mediated EMT via the ERK1/2 and STAT3 pathways, thereby providing experimental evidence for IL-24 as a novel therapeutic target and IL-37 as a promising agent for treating severe asthma.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Excessive inflammatory responses contribute to the pathogenesis and lethality of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the N proteins of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), were found to bind MASP-2, a key serine protease in the lectin pathway of complement activation, resulting in excessive complement activation by potentiating MBL-dependent MASP-2 activation, and the deposition of MASP-2, C4b, activated C3 and C5b-9. Aggravated inflammatory lung injury was observed in mice infected with adenovirus expressing the N protein. Complement hyperactivation was also observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Either blocking the N protein:MASP-2 interaction, MASP-2 depletion or suppressing complement activation can significantly alleviate N protein-induced complement hyperactivation and lung injury in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, these data suggested that complement suppression may represent a novel therapeutic approach for pneumonia induced by these highly pathogenic coronaviruses.\",\n",

Biochemical and molecular assays were used to determine the effects of drugs on T cell functions in cell culture models and in mouse/human tumor tissues. Allograft tumor models with K-ras mutation were used to investigate the combination effect of gemcitabine or cisplatin with immunotherapy. Data of lung cancer patients with K-ras mutation treated with cisplatin and toripalimab were analyzed to evaluate the clinical relevance of the lab findings.\\nCisplatin and gemcitabine unexpectedly exert opposite effect on the therapeutic activity of PD-1 antibody in vivo. Gemcitabine antagonizes the therapeutic effect of PD-1 antibody due to its significant inhibition on CD8\\nOur study shows that a key factor in selecting chemotherapeutic agents for immunochemotherapy is the drug's impact on T cell functions, and that cisplatin-based chemotherapy is an excellent choice for combination with immune checkpoint antibody to achieve favorable clinical outcome.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Capsaicin (CAP) is an alkaloid isolated from pepper fruit, which possesses various pharmacological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and gastric mucosa protection. However, its inherent poor aqueous solubility and strong irritation impede the further clinical application. In our study, acyclic cucurbit[n]urils (ACBs, M1, M2 and M3) were rationally utilized to prepare a series of CAP inclusion complexes to improve the bioavailability and reduce stimulation. Their properties and inclusion behaviors were further investigated by multiple characterization methods, the data indicated that the inclusion complexes of ACBs/CAP were formed by a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 with strong binding interaction. After complexation, the solubility of CAP was significantly increased by 12,076 times and its antioxidant activity also increased. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory activity and the ability to prevent gastric mucosal injury were both significantly improved, and the inhibition rate of nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-1\\u03b2 (IL-1\\u03b2) has been effectively improved while cytotoxicity against human normal hepatocytes cell (LO2), human lung fibroblasts cell (HLF) and the human gastric mucosal cell (GES-1) was greatly attenuated. Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) images indicated that the complexes could be efficiently internalized by GES-1 cells and primarily located in cytoplasm. In vivo model of mouse, our complexes exhibited excellent biosafety. In summary, our study may provide a promising new strategy for the further clinical application of CAP.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Detoxification of glutathione (GSH) and insufficient cellular uptake of cisplatin (CDDP) severely compromised the therapeutic efficacy of CDDP. Here, a nano-delivery system (BT-4@PtPPNPs) for CDDP prodrug (C16-Pt(\\u2163)-PEG) based on a novel sulfhydryl blocking reagent methyl 2-(methylsulfonyl) benzothiazole-6-carboxylate (BT-4) was developed. On the one hand, BT-4 can deplete GSH in tumor cells by directly interacting with reactive sulfhydryl group on GSH, thereby increasing the cytotoxicity of CDDP. On the other hand, the CDDP prodrug carrier C16-Pt(IV)-PEG can promote the distribution of CDDP in tumors, reduce the probability of unexpected inactivation of CDDP, and reduce the content of GSH in tumor cells during the conversion to CDDP, thereby making CDDP more effective for treatment. The results showed that the optimized BT-4@PtPPNPs with a small particle size (130\\u00a0nm) exhibited notable cytotoxicity and apoptosis of 4T1 cells. BT-4@PtPPNPs not only significantly improved the uptake of drugs by tumor cells, but also rapidly targeted and accumulated in the tumors for a long time. Moreover, in vivo efficacy studies showed that BT-4@PtPPNPs could effectively inhibit tumor growth, inhibiting 60.85\\u00a0% of tumors in a 4T1 breast cancer mice model, showing superior antitumor activity, which can be attributed to GSH-triggered CDDP tolerance reversal. Overall, this study provides an attractive and simple strategy to combine novel sulfhydryl blockers and CDDP prodrugs to potentiate the efficacy of CDDP in breast cancer.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Among pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients, right ventricular (RV) functioning has been considered a major determining factor for cardiac capacity and survival. However, despite the recognition of the clinical importance for preserving RV functioning, no effective treatments are currently available for RV failure. This study aims to suggest one such possible treatment, through investigating the cardio-protective capabilities of the anti-oxidant, melatonin (Mel), for treating adverse RV remodeling in PAH, along with its underlying mechanisms. Arginine vasopressin induced neonatal rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro; in vivo, PAH was induced in rats through intraperitoneal monocrotaline (MCT) injections, and Mel was administered intraperitoneally 24\\u00a0h prior to MCT. Mel reduced rat cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and mitochondrial oxidative stress in vitro by activating the Mst1-Nrf2 pathway, which were all reversed upon siRNA knockdown of Mst1. Likewise, in vivo, Mel pre-treatment significantly ameliorated MCT-induced deterioration in cardiac function, RV hypertrophy, fibrosis and dilation. These beneficial effects were also associated with Mst1-Nrf2 pathway up regulation and its associated reduction in oxidative stress, as evidenced by the decrease in RV malondialdehyde content. Notably, results from Mel treatment were similar, or even superior, to those obtained from N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), which has already been-confirmed as an anti-oxidative treatment for PAH. By contrast, co-treatment with the Mst1 inhibitor XMU-MP-1 reversed all of those Mel-associated beneficial effects. Our findings thus identified Mel as a potent cardio-protective agent against the onset of maladaptive RV remodeling, through enhancement of the anti-oxidative response via Mst1-Nrf2 pathway activation.\",\n",

      "    \"abstract\": \"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently used drugs due to their values in attenuating pain, fever and inflammation. Unfortunately, conspicuous adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal (GI) damage and/or cardiovascular events have impeded their application in clinic. M378 is a novel hydrogen sulfide-releasing NSAIDs with uncompromised potency and negligible toxicity compared to the existing NSAIDs. However, its anti-inflammatory activity and mechanism are still an enigma. Here we investigated the effect of M378 on the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway and addressed the underlying molecular mechanism. Our data in vitro showed that M378 dose-dependently inhibited the cleavage of Caspase-1 and the secretion of active IL-1\\u03b2 and blocked NLRP3-dependent pyroptosis in LPS-primed J774A.1 macrophages. Furthermore, M378 remarkably inhibited upstream ASC oligomerization and ROS production regarding the process of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Our data in vivo demonstrated that M378 protected mice from acute liver injury, reducing the levels of ALT/AST and IL-1\\u03b2 and improving hepatic pathological damages. Immunoblot analysis revealed that M378 inhibited the expressions of Caspase-1 and IL-1\\u03b2 in liver tissues of ALI mice. We also showed that M378 alleviated IL-1\\u03b2 secretion and peritoneal neutrophils infiltration in MSU-elicited acute peritonitis mice. In conclusion, M378 exerted its anti-inflammatory effect both in vitro and in vivo and its mechanisms are at least connected to its inhibitory performance on the generation of ASC oligomers and ROS production. These findings give an insight. into the molecular mechanism of hydrogen sulfide-releasing NSAIDs and support a potent therapeutic role of M378 in the treatment of NLRP3-driven inflammatory diseases.\",\n",
